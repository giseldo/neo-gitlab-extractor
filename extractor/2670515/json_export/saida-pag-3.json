Please see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6037#note_1196864310 for more background.\n\nHere are a few things we can consider:\n1. ~~Avoid showing or updating `Customer.company` in this form.  At this point, `BillingAccount.zuora_account_name` should be the attribute used across the app.  There should be no need to maintain `company`~~. EDIT: follow-up in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5656\n2. `UpdateContactService` is called only from a Customer model callback. It's only triggered when the virtual attr `sync_with_zuora` is set, which only happens [in the RegistrationsController](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/37933553209ad5c0b13c33ab2a786200c2aa4d27/app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb#L36).

Both production and staging environments are on PSQL 12 now.\nThat means we can safely drop PSQL 10 from the list of supported runtimes and tools. Currently we have it in the `.tool-versions` file and in order to remove it from this file we should create or document convenient way for upgrading existing databases of team members (located in `./db/postgesql`).\n\n## How to upgrade local PSQL database from 10 to 12\n\nGiven the database is running in `./db/postgresql` we can perform the following steps to upgrade it:\n\n1. Stop the application\n2. Stop the PSQL master:\n\n   ```shell\n   asdf exec pg_ctl stop -D ./db/postgresql\n   ```\n\n3. Demote the data folder to old cluster:\n\n   ```shell\n   mv ./db/postgresql ./db/postgresql-10\n   ```\n\n3. Activate PostgreSQL 12 binaries:\n\n   ```shell\n   asdf shell postgres 12.12\n   ```\n\n   Verify it with `psql --version`. This command must output `psql (PostgreSQL) 12.12`\n\n4. Check the upgrade path:\n\n   ```shell\n   asdf exec pg_ctl initdb -D ./db/postgresql-12\n   asdf exec pg_upgrade --old-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 10.17)/bin --new-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 12.12)/bin --old-datadir=./db/postgresql-10 --new-datadir=./db/postgresql-12 --check\n   ```\n   \n   Look for the `*Clusters are compatible*` line at the end. If not, please report in this issue.\n\n5. Do the upgrade:\n\n   ```shell\n   asdf exec pg_upgrade --old-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 10.17)/bin --new-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 12.12)/bin --old-datadir=./db/postgresql-10 --new-datadir=./db/postgresql-12\n   ```\n\n6. Start the new PSQL 12 master:\n\n   ```shell\n   asdf exec pg_ctl start -D ./db/postgresql-12\n   ```\n\n7. Generate minimal optimizer statistics to verify the new database: `./analyze_new_cluster.sh`\n8. Run the script to delete the old database data: `./delete_old_cluster.sh`\n9. Move the new database cluster to the old location `./db/postgresql`:\n\n   ```shell\n   asdf exec pg_ctl stop -D ./db/postgresql-12 \u0026\u0026 mv ./db/postgresql-12 ./db/postgresql\n   ```\n\n10. Remove migration files: `rm analyze_new_cluster.sh delete_old_cluster.sh update_extensions.sql`\n11. Start the new database cluster and verify your local copy of CustomersDot still works:\n\n   ```shell\n   asdf exec pg_ctl start -D ./db/postgresql\n   ```","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-12-02T15:30:28.580Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T08:12:51.982Z","closed_at":"2023-03-07T08:12:51.948Z","closed_by":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"labels":["devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","maintenance::dependency","missed:15.9","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance","workflow::complete"],"milestone":{"id":2745651,"iid":85,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.10","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:22.132Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T16:58:22.132Z","due_date":"2023-03-17","start_date":"2023-02-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/85"},"assignees":[{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"}],"author":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"user_notes_count":34,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5272","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5272","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5272/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5272/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5272","relative":"#5272","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5272"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119743087,"iid":5269,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Add logging in CloudActivations::ActivateService when seat link creation failed","description":"### Problem\n\nWhen an activation of a self-managed instance with an activation code failed because of an error while creating the seat link data, the error is [logged by the SeatLinkCreateService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/seat_link_create_service.rb#L24-27).

With Zuora Ramps, we are establishing automated provisioning of licenses for the entire ramp subscription period, so this shortened term is no longer necessary.\n\nWith the Zuora workflow being setup by EntApps, callouts will be sent from Zuora to CDot whenever a new ramp interval starts in order to provision additional seats at the start at each ramp interval.\n\n### Problem\n\nAs discussed in this thread https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4295#note_1189876785, ramped subscriptions where cloud licensing is enabled have licenses generated for the full subscription term.  For example, if a subscription has a 3 one year ramps, the full subscription term is 3 years, and therefore has a license generated for the full 3 years.  If the quantity changes when a new ramp begins, a callout will be sent to CDot to generate a new license with the new quantity for the full term.\n\nThe logic for determining the license end date can be [found here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ec6b3cc9dca0e511568ba86c0b3d6db99cfdcd19/app/models/concerns/license_creation.rb#L15).  Currently, this logic only applies to Subscriptions with cloud licensing enabled, but we need it for Subscriptions with legacy licenses too.\n\n### Proposal\n\nUpdate the `LicenseCreation#license_end_date` method to determine the license end date consistently for all ramp enabled subscriptions, using the term end date.\n\n\n### Proposal Summary\n\nGenerate the initial license for a ramp subscription for the entire 3 year subscription term (and then send a new license for only the additional users at the start of each year).\n\nReason for this proposal, rather than generating the initial license for 1 year and sending a new license for the full user amount at the start of each year:\n1. We are moving towards generating all licenses for the entire subscription term, not just ramps ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4816)), as it requires less manual intervention. Option 2 is consistent with this motion.\n1. There is no risk of the customer losing access entirely if there is any provision failure at the start of years 2/3 - only not having access to the additional seats. Seems this could result in fewer support escalations.\n1. This was the plan with cloud license enabled subscriptions, so to me it makes sense to keep both types consistent.\n\n### Proposal Details\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4879 updated the existing license end date logic to generate ramp enabled licenses for the full subscription term for cloud enabled subscriptions _only_. We should remove this condition on cloud enabled by updating [this line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ec6b3cc9dca0e511568ba86c0b3d6db99cfdcd19/app/models/concerns/license_creation.rb#L15).\n\nI think we want to update this:\n\u003e `# If Subscription is cloud and (reconciliations or ramps enabled), we issue it for the full term`\n\nTo this:\n\u003e `# If Subscription is (cloud and reconciliations) or ramps enabled, we issue it for the full term`\n\nSide note, once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4816 is implemented, the logic will actually be:\n\u003e `# If Subscription is cloud or ramps enabled, we issue it for the full term`\n\n### Result\nAll ramp licenses (whether cloud or not) are created for the full term.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-30T21:07:42.343Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T16:04:21.190Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T14:32:43.758Z","closed_by":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"labels":["Category:SM Provisioning","License Activation","Ramps Provisioning","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::ready for development"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5247","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5247","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5247/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5247/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5247","relative":"#5247","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5247"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9354,"epic":{"id":668676,"iid":9354,"title":"[SM] Automated Provisioning for Ramp Deals","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9354","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 15, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":119653137,"iid":5246,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Deprecate Unified License mailers \u0026 remove SS aware check","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

This was sent to customers who had `TurnOnCloudLicensing` set to `null`. As part of SCL, we removed the legacy license from this mailer as we began to treat `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `null` customers the same as `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `Yes`. Therefore it is now a duplicate of the activation code mailer.\n\nIn addition, the check for `super_sonics_aware` is no longer necessary. Since we are over 1 year past the launch of Super Sonics (August 2021), all new or renewal subscriptions will now be super sonics aware. This can be removed as unnecessary logic.\n\nRelated part of code:\n![image](/uploads/c8fad86be7698188a6258e238c1f69ca/image.png)\n\n### Proposal\nDeprecate the unified license mailer and simplify the existing mailer logic to send only the legacy, offline or activation code mailer as is appropriate based on the license type the customer will receive, with no dependency on `super_sonics_aware`.\n\nRough suggestion:\n* If legacy, send legacy mailer\n* If offline, send offline mailer\n* Else, must be online, so send online mailer (reordered as I think online mailer should be the default)\n\nIn addition, we should deprecate the related [unified voucher email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/mailers/unified_license_voucher_mailer_spec.rb), as this will no longer be needed.\n\n### Result\nSimplification in our customer mailers.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

Note we don't have a callback that will sync back to CDot changes on the Zuora account `crm_id` that result from merging SFDC accounts and manually updated the references to the surviving account.

(licenses@gitlab.com). \n\nSince we are trying to improve our Proof of License Delivery mechanisms for resellers, ensuring that Cloud Licensing renewals and subscription updates are available for them seems like a logic next step.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIntroduce a new `CloudLicenseVoucherMailer` with two methods (one for renewals and another for subscription updates) and call those methods from the corresponding notification.\n\n### Result\n\n* The vouchers provide better visibility for the Sales and Order Management teams by storing them in SFDC\n* The vouchers provide better visibility for resellers by sending them to the `Invoice Owner` of the partner\n\n### Reported Examples\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/351040 - OM team requesting copy of renewal on

Remove Premium plan\n2. Add Ultimate plan\n\nIn Zuora staging environment, the order in which the invoice items generated are different for Amend and Orders API:\n\n- When using Amend API: `Remove Premium plan`, `Add Ultimate plan`\n- When using Orders API: `Add Ultimate plan`, `Remove Premium plan`\n\nThe order of Order actions is: `RemoveProduct`, `AddProduct` (see example [Order object](https://test.zuora.com/apps/newlogin.do?retURL=/orders#/view/O-00150386))\n\n**Problem statement**:\n\nWhen creating SalesForce objects, a [single Quote Rate Plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/4beb9cee77c7b495c0bd9e3f543599c919beaadf/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_objects_service.rb#L168) is created for an invoice (based on the first invoice item).\n\nThe order of the invoice items therefore becomes significant, as it causes [`zqu__ProductRatePlan__c`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a83ed49dff1dc0dddce7105d26af4244fbf0de72/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_rate_plan_service.rb#L80) and [`zqu__ProductRatePlanZuoraId__c`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a83ed49dff1dc0dddce7105d26af4244fbf0de72/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_rate_plan_service.rb#L81) attributes to be different in both cases.\n\nIn the case of Amend API, `zqu__ProductRatePlanZuoraId__c` is associated with Premium Plan, while in Orders API it is associated with Ultimate Plan.\n\nThis [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ltJBcLwOau3-95CuHCwlXiZP200XkCqdeKtdpoYNUBI/edit?usp=drive_web\u0026ouid=113070913643997337994) documents the comparison.\nIn the case of sandbox environment, I observed the order of the invoice items to be the same (see [spreadsheet, tab 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mydR5iZd4709tLkKRal30vE3Xad1dsxGOzCwhiwB7HQ/edit)).\n\nThe scope of this issue is to understand:\n\n- Should a single Quote Rate Plan OR multiple Quote Rate Plans (one for each invoice item) be created\n- Based on the answer to the above question, if a single Quote Rate Plan needs to be created, should it be created for `RemoveProduct` or `AddProduct` or if it does not have a significance.\n\nRelated Slack conversation: https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C043J3R2L9F/p1668494901620589\n\n### Proposal\n\n\u003c!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~\"Enterprise Applications\" team if Zuora business logic is involved. --\u003e\n\nSummarizing the [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5193#note_1179678115), the following changes need to be applied when creating objects using Orders API:\n\n1. Based on SalesForce package, for each order action type, 1 Quote Amendment, 1 Quote Rate Plan and 1 Quote Rate Plan Charge needs to be created. This approach will also resolve the inconsistent order detailed in this issue.\n\n   In the existing Amend API workflow, 1 Quote Amendment is created for each amendment type. For every invoice, 1 Quote Rate Plan is created, and for every invoice item, 1 Quote Rate Plan Charge is created. No change to be made in this workflow.\n\n1. Additionally, charge summary needs to be created for each amendment type. Given this is not currently created in Amend API, created https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5211 to follow-up on the requirement.\n\n1. `Amendment.Id` and `Amendment.Name` is `nil` in the case of Orders API. @sbaranidharan to confirm if these attributes can be determined from any other object in Zuora.\n\n   -\u003e The Zuora team mentioned the values will be `nil` since we have orders harmonization enabled.\n\n### Result\n\nWith the above approach, the problem stated in this issue is resolved as we create Quote Rate plan for every order action type and are no longer dependent on the order of order action types.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-17T09:02:24.434Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T18:35:13.385Z","closed_at":"2022-12-06T18:31:55.974Z","closed_by":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"labels":["backend","bug::functional","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","priority::2","section::fulfillment","severity::3","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2717597,"iid":82,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.7","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T14:48:31.199Z","due_date":"2022-12-17","start_date":"2022-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/82"},"assignees":[{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"}],"author":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5193","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5193","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5193/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5193/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5193","relative":"#5193","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5193"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9045,"epic":{"id":629636,"iid":9045,"title":"Transition Subscription Upgrade workflow to use Orders API","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9045","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Jan 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118807974,"iid":5177,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Refactor feature specs for rails admin","description":"### Problem\n\nIn https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5886#note_1172520728, it was brought up that having 2 actions with 2 assertions in one example isn't usually best practice.

With this we would get the additional advantage of being tested. The same helper could be used for

Platform PI instrumentalization: Developer Productivity","description":"## Overview\n\nWe want to measure `MTTR` (mean time to recovery) as one of the ~\"group::fulfillment platform\" performance indicators. This will help us to capture the state and progress of the developer productivity within the fulfillment infrastructure we provide.\n\n## Details\n\nThe proposal and progress of the PI is captured in the [Fulfillment PI internal handbook section](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/fulfillment-section/#fulfillment-platform---mean-time-to-recovery-mttr).\n\n**Definition of MTTR: Measure time (in minutes) between interruption of service(s) due to deployment/system failure and full recovery**\n\nAfter a [first feedback loop](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/876#note_1165028722), and a sync discussion we identified a way how to instrument this metric:\n\nWe capture events whenever CustomersDot enters and leaves maintenance mode. This is visible when the `HealthCheck::Zuora` and `HealthCheck::Gitlab` jobs are triggered and when they catch changes of availability of these third-party services.\n\nAdditionally, triggering the maintenance mode manually (through the `customers:maintenance_mode` rake task) should also capture such events for the creation of this metric.\n\n\n## Outcome\n\nWe can measure and see MTTR as a first iteration in the ~\"group::fulfillment platform\" Grafana Dashboard.\n\n\n## High-level implementation\n\nBelow is an attempt to come-up with a plan to achieve the outcome highlighted above. This is likely to be refined before we start work.\n\nThis plan also takes into consideration requirements outlined in [this other issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5579), as there are overlaps between both issues:\n\n1. Update our Prometheus collector\n   - Our metrics collector is currently suited for Sidekiq jobs and app/api controllers. We'll have to update it so that it can also capture data when entering / leaving maintenance mode (and when raising Zuora error, wrt to this other issue)\n2. Implement new Prometheus collection \n   - Apply actual collection of data in related Health cron jobs and the maintenance rake task.\n3. Update [the Runbooks project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)\n   - We need to do that so that we can bridge data from Prometheus to new graphs in Grafana\n\n### Issue breakdown\n\nThe plan above led to the creation of the following issue breakdown:\n\n1. [ ] [Allow Prometheus collection of maintenance events](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5718)\n2. [ ] [Add Grafana dashboard to show new MTTR

[Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)\n\n## Report\n\n#####  Summary\n\n(there is an lack of input validation via email parameter. giving high lenghts will prompt 500 Internal error. making fast requests to the internal server error will make the server down for everyone ! )\n\n#####  Steps to reproduce\n\n(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)\n\n1. Register like any new user. use random details.  \n1. The next page should be ( /email_confirmations )   \n1. So now upload my payload from the attachement and use it on the email input.   \n1. Make sure to send the request in repeater and you receive 500 internal error.  \n1. Run turbo intruder or intruder. ( i used turbo-intruder ) good threads then start the attack. \n\n#####  Impact\n\n(Summarize the impact on users)\n\nNo one will be able to login or navigate into Gitlab Customers . the server has been highly affected with only an test attack ! server has been down for long time ! and i believe the same issue will happen on gitlab.com ( official server ) i tried just to get the 500 internal error on the main website and yeah i got it !\n\n####  Impact\n\nA Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.\n\n## Attachments\n\n**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!\n\n* [publicdown2.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/30c9b9c4-4ea1-4f24-afbe-d8245063798f/publicdown2.png)\n* [publiccheck1.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/560bd0a6-d78b-48d5-8edc-48664cb78f02/publiccheck1.png)\n* [DOWN.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/fdb5a210-a03f-4fce-b48b-994ca130209d/DOWN.png)\n* [500forall.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/1d4cece0-ddf0-4d96-b59b-0673cf36f26e/500forall.png)\n* [payload.txt](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/21d12a27-9c3d-4f54-888f-4d142f06c8f6/payload.txt)\n* [17min-idk.png](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/ee1c1301-a8a4-4f86-866d-fdc72419654a/17min-idk.png)\n* [2022-11-08_04-13-47.mkv](https://h1.sec.gitlab.net/a/535a4ab8-452a-4d1a-af07-5e551b0894a6/2022-11-08_04-13-47.mkv)\n\n## How To Reproduce\n\nPlease add [reproducibility information] to this section:\n\n1.\n1.\n1.\n\n[reproducibility information]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-10T16:53:11.534Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T22:46:08.355Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T09:54:30.558Z","closed_by":{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James Lopez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/273486/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jameslopez"},"labels":["HackerOne","Weakness::CWE-400","bug::vulnerability","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","priority::2","section::fulfillment","security","severity::2","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":2687593,"iid":81,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.6","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T19:22:27.893Z","due_date":"2022-11-17","start_date":"2022-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/81"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":2741139,"username":"gitlab-securitybot","name":"GitLab SecurityBot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2741139/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-securitybot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-12-26","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5169","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5169","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5169/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5169/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5169","relative":"#5169","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5169"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":118429246,"iid":5138,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Remove breadcrumbs","description":"### Problem\n\nLong time ago we introduced breadcrumbs for CustomersDot but the application has changed a lot since then and I suggest we remove breadcrumbs from the application because of following reasons:\n\n1.

It could not be created due to the used email already existing in the system in a `Customer` record.\n\nThe used workflow for the `Customer` record creation uses [FindOrCreateCustomerService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb). This service first attempts to [find a `Customer` record](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L14) via email before [creating a new one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L17) in case none was found. This doesn't add up with the error we are seeing though (since first no record was found but then on creation there suddenly was one). Looking closer into the used emails, it turns out that the two mentioned examples both have a `\\t` (some kind of whitespaces) at the end of the email. While it's correct that no `Customer` record is found when looking for one by email, upon attempting to create one, I think devise will automatically strip the whitespace from the email ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/config/initializers/devise.rb#L56)). Which explains why the email already exists error shows up at that step.\n\n### Proposal\n\nStrip any whitespaces before looking for a `Customer` record by email in the `FindOrCreateCustomerService` ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L45)).\n\n### Result\n\nStripping the whitespace before the lookup will find the already existing `Customer` record and any workflow that is supposed to be executed along with this logic will succeed and not fail anymore.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-03T15:25:27.390Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T16:17:48.466Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T15:02:48.014Z","closed_by":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna

Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n# Summary\n\nWe are introducing logic that will populate `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` as part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950+ given we are going to iteratively add small bits we want to make sure we update at least all the places listed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4795+ before start collecting the data in production.\n\nThis issue is to rollout the persistence of the data related to `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` currently behind the [`account_data_persistence`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/171/edit) feature flag.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::fulfillment platform\" \n- Most appropriate Slack channel to reach out to: `#g_fulfillment_platform`\n- Best individual to reach out to: @tyleramos or @vshumilo \n- PM: @mgass1 \n\n## Stakeholders\n\nNo other stakeholders.\n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\nRollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nCustomer's associated billing account is kept up to date with `customer.zuora_account_id`.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\n- Disruptive exceptions in the code.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\n- Keep an eye on [Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/#).\n- Check `#s_fulfillment_status` for errors.\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.\n- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.\n- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process) - **Lena: Based on the criteria there is no need for change management issue\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.**\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering\n- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on CustomersDot production\n\n- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)\n- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.\n- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `\u003cfeature-flag-name\u003e` feature flag\n  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production\n- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)\n- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected\n- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:\n  -

If the namespace info is missing the new subscription mail should be used instead.\n   1. Remove the reference to \"new subscription\" in the email subject and body.\n1. Update logic to send the correct mailer based on subscription type (Renewal, Amendment, New Subscription)\n1. Ensure the newer version of the template design is used, consistent with the current New Subscription SaaS purchase email\n1. Put the new mailer behind a feature flag ([`new_saas_mailers`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/209/edit)) until the voucher email is implemented.\n\n**Note:** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6085+ should be completed directly after this one.\n\n### Result\n1. Customer and revenue receive an email confirmation when a SaaS renewal is completed that clearly outlines a renewal occurred.\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?\n\nPlease list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.\n* Unit test changes\n* Integration test changes\n* End-to-end test change\n\nSee the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning --\u003e\n\nAdding a mailer, should be accompanied by several tests.\n\n- Mailer Specs\n  - Mailer Subject\n  - Mailer To/From (multiple To's? If so, which is first?)\n  - Mailer Body?\n- When is this Mailer activated?  Only during renewal?","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-10-27T20:14:44.500Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T11:15:07.999Z","closed_at":"2023-05-03T11:15:07.975Z","closed_by":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"labels":["Category:SaaS Provisioning","Technical Writing","UX","backend","devops::fulfillment","documentation","emails","feature flag","feature::addition","frontend","group::provision","missed:15.8","priority::3","quad-planning::complete-action","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::complete"],"milestone":{"id":2633524,"iid":80,"group_id":9970,"title":"16.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-05-30T16:25:25.778Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T16:25:25.778Z","due_date":"2023-05-17","start_date":"2023-04-18","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/80"},"assignees":[{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"}],"author":{"id":7964536,"username":"courtmeddaugh","name":"Courtney Meddaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7964536/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/courtmeddaugh"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4799322,"username":"cwiesner","name":"Corinna Gogolok","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4799322/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cwiesner"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5057","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5057","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5057/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/5057/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#5057","relative":"#5057","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5057"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":9117,"epic":{"id":638939,"iid":9117,"title":"Improve SaaS customer mailers","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9117","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"May 31, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e25\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":"on_track"},{"id":117686598,"iid":5053,"project_id":2670515,"title":"[Testing] Preview subscription upgrade workflow using Orders API","description":"### Problem\n\nThis issue is to track the verification process to enable the use of 'Orders API in Preview Subscription Upgrade workflow'.\n\n**Associated FF:** [`use_orders_api_to_preview_upgrade `](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5051)\n\n### Testing scenarios\n| Scenario | Steps | Expected result | Pass?
