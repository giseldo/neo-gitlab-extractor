The test was held June 1-11, 2020.\n\n### Problem\n\nThere has been a long history of source code disclosure vulnerabilities in web and application servers. Any of these in conjunction with hard-coded secrets in an application‚Äôs source could result in their compromise. Additionally, improper server configuration could result in these files being readable by external users. Finally, code is often stored in code repositories with loose access controls, creating another point of potential compromise.\n\nHere is a redacted snippet of hard-coded secrets:\n```ruby\nrequest:\n    method: post\n    uri: https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token\n    body:\n      string: grant_type=password\u0026client_id=[REDACTED]\u0026client_secret=[REDACTED]\u0026u\n    sername=[REDACTED]\u0026password=[REDACTED]\n    ...\n  response:\n...\nstring: '{\"access_token\":\"\u003cACCESS_TOKEN\u003e\",\"instance_url\":\"https://cs63.sale sforce.com\",\"id\":\"https://test.salesforce.com/id/00D6C0000004d0KUAQ/005610000 024BDwAAM\",\"token_type\":\"Bearer\",\"issued_at\":\"1589895566673\",\"signature\":\"[RE DACTED]\"}'\n```\n\nIt appears that these secrets are used mostly in development or staging environments, thus lowering the severity.\n\nThe following file locations are affected:\n* README.md:78\n* README.md:148\n* config/secrets.yml.example:59\n* db/seeds.rb:18\n* spec/fixtures/vcr_cassettes/Change_namespace_of_existing_subscription/change_group_of_active_subscription/successfully_change_namespace_for_subscription.yml:600\n* spec/fixtures/vcr_cassettes/zuora_ee_plan_fetch.yml:88\n\n### Proposal\n\nSensitive data should not be stored directly in source, but should instead be referenced from configuration files that exist outside of the application‚Äôs root. When checking code into a repository, use example files or stubs which are overwritten when the application is deployed.\n\nAll secrets that have been checked into the source code repositories should be considered compromised, and changed.\n\n### Result\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T17:23:27.572Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T11:56:09.988Z","closed_at":"2020-08-17T08:39:27.969Z","closed_by":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"labels":["Data team review","Deliverable","[deprecated] üçé","devops::fulfillment","devops::growth","priority::1","security","severity::4","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"}],"author":{"id":2719180,"username":"estrike","name":"Ethan Strike","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2719180/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/estrike"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1986039,"username":"lulalala","name":"Mark Chao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1986039/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/lulalala"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1546","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1546","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1546/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1546/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1546","relative":"#1546","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1546"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":43758760,"iid":1543,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Do not render \"Change linked namespace\" for CI only subscriptions","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

Customer portal will generate a working license the for the updated license. However, if customer add more users later on during the same license period, all the new license will have the `Previous users count` of the `Users count` at the beginning of license term and `True-up` of the first Add more users of the license.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Purchase License term: 2020-05-01 - 2021-05-01 and upload to the system. \n    - Users count originally purchase: `50`\n\n\n2. Add more user `7` to the license for the first time 2020-05-30 and upload to the system:\n   - New Users count: `57`\n   - Previous users count: `50`\n   - True-up: `7` \n\n\n3. Add more user `10` to the license for the second time 2020-06-02 and upload to the system:\n   - New `Users count`: `67`\n   - Previous users count: `50`\n   - True-up: `7`\n\n\n4. Add more user `20` to the license for the third time 2020-06-05 and upload to the system:\n   - New `Users count`: `87`\n   - Previous users count: `50`\n   - True-up: `7`\n\nThis would cause error when uploading `#3` and `#4` because they are not referencing the license currently on the system.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nNew license after adding more users to license multiple time keep referencing the license at the beginning of the license term.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAdd more users to license multiple time should correctly referencing the latest license on the system.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nManually generate a working license\n\n### Reported examples\n\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/159073\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/160766\n1. \n\n\u003c!---\nPlease add both severity and priority level according to: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels\n---\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-04T02:52:04.293Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T14:10:32.819Z","closed_at":"2020-08-08T00:01:34.992Z","closed_by":{"id":280339,"username":"rdavila","name":"Rub√©n D√°vila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/280339/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdavila"},"labels":["Deliverable","awaiting feedback","backend","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","missed:13.2","section::fulfillment","severity::2","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233752,"iid":50,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.3","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:39:21.090Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:50:18.976Z","due_date":"2020-08-17","start_date":"2020-07-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/50"},"assignees":[{"id":280339,"username":"rdavila","name":"Rub√©n D√°vila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/280339/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdavila"}],"author":{"id":786864,"username":"rotanak","name":"Sokunrotanak Srey (Rotanak)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e138f6598fa362b95f725febc80087e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rotanak"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":280339,"username":"rdavila","name":"Rub√©n D√°vila","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/280339/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rdavila"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1495","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1495","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1495/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1495/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1495","relative":"#1495","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1495"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":35408070,"iid":1494,"project_id":2670515,"title":"NoMethodError/sidekiq undefined method `match' for #\u003cRack::Session::SessionId:0x000000000b50f5e0\u003e","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

We specifically removed the `Renew` button because the system wasn't processing the renewal properly upon selection. \n\n## Proposal\nAs per the Sales/Finance [policy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/1653#note_422409896) of updating customer subscriptions to cancelled and closing the respective Renewal opportunity 30 days after subscription term end date, we should allow the customer to renew their expired subscription within customers.gitlab.com with a 30 day grace period as well.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. This applies to both GitLab.com and Self-Managed subscriptions\n1. This change does not extend the paid entitlement (SM license/GitLab.com paid features), nor the period in which the customer is entitled to paid support \n1. In customers.gitlab.com, when the expiration date is reached, all action buttons (upgrade, add seats, autorenew) should be removed except `Renew`\n1. The user should be able to select the `Renew` button for a period of 30 days post the expiration date\n1. Customers.gitlab.com should present the standard Renewal purchase flow to the customer and accept payment during checkout\n     1. If payment fails, the transaction should not be processed and no change should be sent to Zuora\n     1. If payment is successful, customers.gitlab.com should send a renewal amendment to Zuora with the subscription details\n\n## Testing \u0026 Availability\n1. `Renew` button is available on CustomersDot manage plan page if plan's expiration date is within last 30 days\n1. For SaaS user, `Renew` button is also available on personal/group billing page\n1. Hide `renew` button if the subscription expired more than 30 days ago\n1. Upon clicking `renew` button, user enters the normal upgrade + renew flow.\n\n\n## Reported examples\n\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/156267\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/157817\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/162428\n1.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-14T02:14:30.750Z","updated_at":"2021-07-09T19:15:08.377Z","closed_at":"2021-01-25T09:31:24.224Z","closed_by":{"id":4903695,"username":"shreyasagarwal","name":"Shreyas Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b09dfe06a10d119c1b2043c43de680?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shreyasagarwal"},"labels":["#field-fyi","Category:Purchase","Deliverable","Fulfillment Priority","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::purchase","missed:13.8","quad-planning::complete-action","section::fulfillment","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":4903695,"username":"shreyasagarwal","name":"Shreyas Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b09dfe06a10d119c1b2043c43de680?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shreyasagarwal"}],"author":{"id":786864,"username":"rotanak","name":"Sokunrotanak Srey (Rotanak)","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9e138f6598fa362b95f725febc80087e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rotanak"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4903695,"username":"shreyasagarwal","name":"Shreyas Agarwal","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b09dfe06a10d119c1b2043c43de680?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/shreyasagarwal"},"user_notes_count":21,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1393","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1393","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1393/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1393/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1393","relative":"#1393","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1393"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":3557,"epic":{"id":65656,"iid":3557,"title":"Self-managed renewal enhancements","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3557","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34525639,"iid":1383,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Add GitLab::Database::MigrationHelpers to Customers Portal","description":"### Problem\nIn the GitLab codebase, it is recommended to use [database helpers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/44d881b91a0ed366a7aec019481840da001cbf5c/lib/gitlab/database/migration_helpers.rb) like `add_column_with_defaults`.  In the Customers portal code, we have some database helpers [defined here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/d08fb068c42c73a857947302c26863020db74edc/lib/database/migrations_helper.rb) but it's not the full set of helpers like GitLab.\n\n### Proposal\nThe ideal solution would be to move these database helpers in GitLab to a library or gem so it can be easily shared and updated in other applications like Customers.  The easier but less elegant solution could be to simply copy the library over to Customers.\n\n### Result\nAccess to more migration helpers making migrations safer and follow standards recommended in the development docs.\n\n-------\n\n@vshumilo added:\n\n**First...**\n\nThere had to make the choice between copying `Gitlab::Database::MigrationHelpers` and its tests\nto the customers app or creating a gem.\nAfter a short analysis it was decided to move with the easiest (less time consuming) approach\nof copying the file because:\n- It solved the immediate need to have the migration helpers available\n- It was less time consuming as it required much less process (we had a time budget in mind)\n- Creating the gem then required Gitlab to be updated to reference and use it as part of the same\nissue otherwise those logics will diverge (again, we had a time budget in mind)\n- Gitlab migration helpers are quite tangled with other modules, lasses and helpers which added challenge to extract all that code\n- :keycap_asterisk: There is already at attempt to [move the helpers into a gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/27307/diffs) in progress so feels like doubling a lot of effors \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Then...**\n\nThe original intention of moving the entire `Gitlab::Database::MigrationHelpers`\nresulted to be an effort bigger than the budget in time and the needs we present at the moment.\n- A lot of the helpers at the `Gitlab` end are very specific. Ex: `backfill_iids`\n- A lot of the helpers at the `Gitlab` end rely on other modules that need to be moved along if we want to move the helpers\n\nAs a result [a half way migration of the helpers into costumers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1433) was resulting in ~4000 new lines of code and a lot of work pending related to fixing the specs by copying the missing dependencies, updating references (some other magnitud of thousands lines). \n\nThis \"size\" overflows the current appetite for this change.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Now...**\n\nAs a result the agreement was to pick 10 methods and move them along as a first iteration.\n\n:exclamation: Try to make sure the methods we pick are methods we might end up needing.\n\nThis is a list of the current methods on the Gitlab end and highlighten are\nthose that count

`remove_concurrent_index_by_name` within `Gitlab::Database::MigrationHelpers` is using a [custom implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/database/migration_helpers.rb#L1084) to check if an index exists by name for the provided table.\nIt is and old implementation and was based on the lack of Rails support to check this AND had a note to be updated as soon as the app was upgraded to Rails \u003e 5.1.7 which introduces [index_name_exists?](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements/index_name_exists%3F)\n\nCreated a [tech-debt issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219285) in the Gitlab context as a reminder so this can be updated on that end too.\n\n\n:whale: Since PostgreSQL 11, adding columns with a default does not lead to a table rewrite anymore. As such, this method is not needed anymore and the default `add_column` helper should be used.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-13T20:29:23.110Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T14:42:57.304Z","closed_at":"2020-05-28T13:39:20.392Z","closed_by":{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James Lopez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/273486/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jameslopez"},"labels":["backend","backstage [DEPRECATED]","database","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1112145,"iid":47,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-03T12:28:30.160Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:01:07.361Z","due_date":"2020-06-17","start_date":"2020-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/47"},"assignees":[{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1383","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1383","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1383/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1383/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1383","relative":"#1383","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1383"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":34519335,"iid":1382,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Graduate Auto Renew cancel experiment from feature flag","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

The Customers Portal should still create Customer records, necessary for keep existing features working like subscription creation and license management, but simply do not allow those Customers to sign in.

Basically anything that refers to the plan could be shared.  It's a minor point as this way works too, but it would be more efficient to avoid the call to Zuora.

When I perform the same action while impersonating the user, I can see the submit button.\n\n#### Steps\n1. From customer account which already has a subscription, navigate to My Account \u003e Payment methods\n1. Select `Add new payment method` button\n1. Fill in details, cc number starting with `51` (to trigger mastercard)\n1. Fill in remaining details\n1. Observe `Submit` button\n\n#### Information from the user\n\n```\n* I am using the latest Chrome on Mac and the screen was 100% without any scroll.\n* It works normally when using a private window\n* And same result as before (no button) outside of incognito mode\n\nI did some digging because I was curious:\n1) The button is there, just not visible because of the height of the surrounding iframe (no scrollbar)\n2) If I manually increase the height of the iframe to 412px (the height in the incognito mode), the button appears\n\nSo weirdly enough, the iframe is not correctly sized outside of incognito mode.\n```\n\n#### Screenshot from user\n![Screen_Shot_2020-03-25_at_18.01.48](/uploads/4416a2661d6c10f9b2d9358837f7941d/Screen_Shot_2020-03-25_at_18.01.48.png)\n\n#### Screenshot when I impersonate the user.\n![Screen_Shot_2020-03-25_at_18.00.15](/uploads/477b38bbaf3bf731d92f9482f3d5ec73/Screen_Shot_2020-03-25_at_18.00.15.png)\n\n#### Reported examples\n\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/151238\n1.\n1.\n1.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-26T00:14:10.635Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T13:58:48.281Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T11:57:40.859Z","closed_by":{"id":447038,"username":"vitallium","name":"Vitaly Slobodin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/74b3243cfcfbfac1f022b78ab505e8d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vitallium"},"labels":["customer","devops::fulfillment","devops::growth","frontend","priority::1","type::bug"],"milestone":{"id":1104429,"iid":46,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.10","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:15:53.243Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T12:00:39.852Z","due_date":"2020-04-17","start_date":"2020-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/46"},"assignees":[{"id":127064,"username":"aalakkad","name":"Ammar Alakkad","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ecc1130ce340f5080afd8f2c9962948a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aalakkad"}],"author":{"id":2890431,"username":"amandarueda","name":"Amanda Rueda","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2890431/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/amandarueda"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":127064,"username":"aalakkad","name":"Ammar Alakkad","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ecc1130ce340f5080afd8f2c9962948a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aalakkad"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1217","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1217","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1217/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/1217/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1217","relative":"#1217","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1217"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32405744,"iid":1211,"project_id":2670515,"title":"ActionView::Template::Error: undefined local variable or method `pending_eula' for #\u003cSubscriptionPresenter:0x000000000a699330\u003e","description":"https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/1381753/?referrer=gitlab_plugin\n\n```\nNameError: undefined local variable or method `pending_eula' for #\u003cSubscriptionPresenter:0x000000000a699330\u003e\n  app/presenters/subscription_presenter.rb:59:in `eula_request_path'\n    @subscription.pending_eula_request ?
