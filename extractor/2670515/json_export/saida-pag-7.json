[{"id":102642045,"iid":4018,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Namespace with extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit may prevent subscription provisioning","description":"**Note:** this issue specifically deals with CI minutes that were added without a purchase (ie via the chatops command) - there is a similar issue that deals with namespaces that have an existing CI minutes pack purchase: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3371+\n\nCame across [a customer](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/263986) (internal) who was unable to link their new subscription purchase through customersDot \"Change linked namespace\".\n\nIn the [related sentry error](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/3130777):\n\n\u003e Namespace change to xxxxxxxx is not allowed: Target namespace can't have additional CI minutes\n\nI tracked this down to the customer having been at one point given extra minutes using the chatops function [`namespace minutes`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/chatops/-/blob/5cdbfaecd14b0a8ee475a0fa3a2f6f09719aad77/lib/chatops/commands/namespace.rb#L65-75), which calls [`GitLab::Client#set_namespace_extra_minutes`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/chatops/-/blob/5cdbfaecd14b0a8ee475a0fa3a2f6f09719aad77/lib/chatops/gitlab/client.rb#L42-45) and that invokes the API to set `extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit`.\n\nThis appears to come from the [namespace validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1af3fcc24508a25e00b1cecc9f62ba15b7164aa2/lib/validators/namespace_transaction_validator.rb#L34) when called by [`UpdatePlanInfoService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/gitlab/namespaces/update_plan_info_service.rb):\n\n\u003e if target_namespace.has_extra_shared_runners_minutes?\n\nmanually setting that value back to 0 (via API) allowed me to successfully link the customer's subscription from their cDot account.\n\nIn [some related discussions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/console-training-wheels/-/merge_requests/100#note_845461902), @tyleramos and @cwiesner noted that this validation may not be needed for all subscription updates, but perhaps more specifically for when a subscription is changing between namespaces.\n\n# Reported examples\n\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/263986\n1.

For instance, many engineers needed to request Zuora User access again to be able to log into the [Zuora web app](https://test.zuora.com/).  ~\"Enterprise Applications\" apps is already working on improving the refresh process by putting together [this playbook of refresh steps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1smfh7LnmKZYtQ5c9GfHxrhs5-7yUkIJQ4N1fywjNMq4/edit).\n\nAnother common problem encountered by people testing in CustomersDot stg after the refresh was the inability to make purchases ([example 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327896#note_808722682), [example 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/477#note_807833598)).  This was due to the fact that Customers in CDot stg had `zuora_account_id`s that no longer referenced accounts in Zuora Central Sandbox post refresh.  We are introducing a rake task in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4229 which will clear these orphaned `zuora_account_ids` from CDot stg.\n\nThis issue is aimed at identifying any other ways we can improve our post-refresh steps as it pertains to CustomersDot.  Are there any other models that should be updated or cleared?  Here are some thoughts I had, but @fulfillment-group/be please offer up others you might have:\n\n- Instead of simply clearing the `zuora_account_id` for customers, would there be value in truncating the entire `customers` table?  People using CDot stg could simply sign up for new customer accounts to avoid confusion.\n- Consider truncating the `orders` table in CDot.  Given that `orders` is strongly tied to Zuora, this table is largely broken when Zuora is refreshed.  Orders with references to `zuora_subscription_name` and `zuora_subscription_id` would be broken.  Should we just start from a clean slate?  In fact, we risk running into collisions if we don't rectify this.\n\nThese are just a few idea to start us off.  Please feel free to add to this list or add your thoughts.\n\n### Proposal\n\nCreate a rake task to truncate DB tables affected by the Zuora refresh.  This might be as simple as using the following command to truncate a list of tables:\n\n```\nActiveRecord::Base.connection.truncate_tables([:table1_name, :table2_name])\n```\n\nThis is a list of tables we could consider not truncating:\n\n* `admins`\n* `customers`: we will clear the zuora_account_ids that no longer match using a separate rake task\n* `features`: to have the correct states of flipper feature flags after the refresh\n* `feature_gates`\n* `schema_migrations`\n* `zuora_user_with_hosts`\n* `coupons`: Check with @rcobb if this can/should be truncated\n* `leads`: Check with `@a_akgun` if this can/should be truncated\n\nWe could include `local_records` in the list of tables to truncate but we'd need to recreate this data by [running the following command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f293ff2309025232e67d51c95171a8150cbf61e3/README.md#update-product-information): `IronBank::LocalRecords.export`.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-13T22:53:28.795Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T21:02:50.229Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T03:32:18.081Z","closed_by":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"labels":["backend","devops::fulfillment","section::fulfillment","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"user_notes_count":49,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2022-02-11","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3926","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3926","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3926/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3926/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3926","relative":"#3926","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#3926"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":100222528,"iid":3918,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Discovery:  Is CDot impacted in any way to known changes of in the Quote objects in SFDC","description":"\u003c!-- Please complete the template below as best as you can.

When a subscription with Ramps is created in Zuora, it does not currently display clearly on the Manage Purchases page. \n1. Due to the complex nature of a Ramp deal, [sales ops has requested](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/505#note_809749301) that users cannot self-add seats or renew a ramp. They should instead be directed to sales.\n\nFor additional details about Ramps, [demos](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8748#ramp-demos-in-zuora-and-sfdc) and [sample data](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8748#sample-data), see the parent epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8748+\n\n## Proposal\n\n### What we show to the customer\n\n1. Display every ramp period on the subscription card, so that the customer is aware how many seats they have access to for the time period.\n2. Hide all subscription action buttons (other than link subscription to SaaS group), and display a message that directs the customer to Sales for subscription changes ([sales ops' request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/505#note_809749301)).\n\n### What the customer can do\n\nThe subscription will be view only. Customer will not be able to make changes to the subscription via Customer Portal.\n\n## Design\n\nThis is a fairly complicated topic, and updating how we display information in the subscription card is a major part of this, so I've recorded 2 videos to walk through the context and the changes.\n\n* [Part 1/2: Ramps overview and why we can't use the current subscription card to display ramps](https://www.loom.com/share/d7fb7744acd14815ae909a64afacf6a4) (4 mins)\n* [Part 2/2: Overview of subscription card changes and how ramped subscriptions are shown in the subscription card](https://www.loom.com/share/8f48c533691c43a6ac6349f1c7d37a13) (7.5 mins)\n\nQuestions that are answered in the video:\n\n* Why can't we use the existing subscription card for ramps display?\n* How does Zuora structure ramps data?\n* What is the new subscription card display that's being proposed?\n* How are we iterating into a new subscription card display? What is the MVC?\n\nAs I mentioned in the video, ramps will be the MVC of the subscription card information hierarchy updates. We'll handle other use cases in later iterations, and I've opened up [an issue for that](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5317). In the design section of this issue, you'll only find ramps-related mockups, so if you're looking for mockups for other use cases they can be found in

Now we can keep only `handle_signed_in_user`\n* cleanup old subscription index view \u0026 modal\n\n:arrow_right: If we decide to keep /subscription page template (but we didn't!)\n\nWe could simply set `root to: 'subscriptions#index'` in [config/routes.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1a001e7db7b361b49dd4c2afb5fea829cc831955/config/routes.rb#L28)\n\nBut then we also need to clean up `SubscriptionsController#index`:\n\n* simplify `@subscriptions = SubscriptionsFinder.for_customer(current_customer)`, just the same as current `VisitorsController#index`\n* update the

the source of the bug was a difference between the Order Processed callout and the New Subscription Created callout.\n\n- `New Subscription Created` callout returns `\u003cparameter name=\"account_crm_id\"\u003e\u003c/parameter\u003e`\n- `Order Processed` callout returns `\u003cparameter name=\"account_crm_id\"\u003enull\u003c/parameter\u003e`\n\nYou can see this in the callout history for [this customer in api sandbox](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/CustomerAccount.do?method=view\u0026id=8ad09f8a7d769bad017d7990c06f3883).\n\n### Proposal\n\nDespite this likely being a bug in Zuora given the discrepancy in how the callouts are handled, we can account for this in CustomersDot when parsing the callout attributes from the request body.  CustomersDot can handle `\"null\"` value as a empty string.  The `Order Processed` callout should then be processed like other callouts at that point.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-02T21:29:32.896Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T22:04:51.445Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T22:04:51.428Z","closed_by":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"labels":["Zuora Orders Harmonization","[deprecated] Category:Provision","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","section::fulfillment","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2114820,"iid":67,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.6","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-23T05:00:52.094Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:26:38.271Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-11-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/67"},"assignees":[{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3844","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3844","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3844/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3844/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3844","relative":"#3844","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#3844"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98197756,"iid":3834,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Instance not able to seat link using existing cloud license","description":"### Problem\n\nAs described in these Slack threads ([first](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C029YFPUA6M/p1637926425309000) and [second](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01BPM66KNE/p1638280781120700)), [a customer](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/221264) who was previously using a license file for their SM subscription ([link to Zuora subscription](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view\u0026id=8a129bb27d37d510017d3a23c8b814a6)), renewed their subscription (on Nov 19) before it was set to expire on Nov 24.  They decided to activate the renewed subscription on Nov 22.  The customer was understandably confused because the new synced cloud license showed information from the subscription term that was about to expire.  They waited until Nov 24 to see if the new subscription details would be synced but found they didn't sync.  Attempts to manually sync the subscription were also unsuccessful.\n\nOn Nov 24, when the new subscription term was set to start, CustomersDot received a seat link request at 03:26:17 and a [cloud license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1009153) was generated for the new term, but this license didn’t seem to get persisted to the instance. Because the new license didn’t get persisted, all future seat link attempts from the instance (auto or manual) used [its current (outdated) license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1009081) key.  In this particular case, it appears the seat link requests for the previous day (report_timestamp = 2021-11-23 12:00:14) updated the LicenseSeatLink records instead of creating new ones.  As part of that update, the `license_id` was updated to [the new cloud license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1009153).  The link to the instance’s license was lost.\n\nWe can see this in the previous versions of this LicenseSeatLink:\n```\nlicense seat link (ver 1):\n  id: 2832633\n  report_timestamp: 2021-11-23 12:00:14\n  updated_at: Tue, 23 Nov 2021 15:59:57\n  license_id: 1009080\n\nlicense seat link (ver 2):\n  updated_at: Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:02:36\n  license_id: 1009081 (a new license because customer `name` changed)\n\nlicense seat link (ver 3):\n  updated_at: Wed, 24 Nov 2021 03:26:17\n  license_id: 1009153 (a new license because `users_count` changed to 30)\n```\n\nThis meant the [lookup here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8c1409ed275594ae63487d1fb85a726297c296f5/app/controllers/api/v1/seat_links_controller.rb#L59) to find the `SelfManagedInstanceActivation` record will no longer work with the existing license.  That’s why we see from Nov 24 until a workaround was used to fix seat link that all `LicenseSeatLink` records created (between nov 24 to 30) did not have a corresponding `license_id` (because they were not considered part of \"cloud sync\".\n\n### Proposal\n\nCustomersDot should avoid updating `license_id` in the `SeatLinkCreateService`, and instead simply add a new `LicenseSeatLink` record instead.  If this logic were used, the next manual or auto seat link request from the customer's instance likely would have resolved the seat link connection and persisted the license for the new term.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-30T20:16:30.177Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T17:23:13.836Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T19:52:05.317Z","closed_by":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"labels":["Cloud License Sync - V2","Cloud Licensing","[deprecated] Category:Provision","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::provision","missed:14.7","section::fulfillment","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":2161849,"iid":70,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.8","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:51:47.677Z","due_date":"2022-02-17","start_date":"2022-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70"},"assignees":[{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3834","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3834","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3834/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3834/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3834","relative":"#3834","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#3834"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":4628,"epic":{"id":127229,"iid":4628,"title":"Cloud Licensing V2","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4628","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":97836212,"iid":3824,"project_id":2670515,"title":"OH Testing: UC-12","description":"## Summary\n\nThis is a specific testing issue for use case 12 on https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6606\n\n### Testing DRIs\n\n|Tester ID | Tester Name | Status |\n|:---:|---|---|\n| 1 |  @a_luna | UC-12a :white_check_mark: Completed \u0026 Passed \u003cbr\u003e UC-12b :white_check_mark: Completed \u0026 Passed \u003cbr\u003e UC-12c :white_check_mark: Completed \u0026 Passed |\n| 2 |  |  |\n\n### UC-12: Quarterly reconciliation adds seats to a subscription\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eUC-12.a: Self-managed subscription\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n| Step ID | Test Step   | Description | Expected Outcome | Testable? | Pass/Fail |\n|---------|--------|----|----------|:---:|:---:|\n| T-1     | Purchase Premium for 5 users (12 months)                                             | New Subscription Purchase.

Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering\n- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated\n- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on CustomersDot production\n\n- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)\n- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.\n- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment \n- [x] Announce on [the feature epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6806) that the feature has been globally enabled.\n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `redirect_plans_page` feature flag https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4124\n  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production\n- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)\n- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected\n- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:\n  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-09T17:38:03.900Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T07:02:49.489Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T14:44:41.726Z","closed_by":{"id":9299375,"username":"dzubova","name":"Diana

Orders Harmonization will be tested as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343474 so that issue is a blocker for this.\n\n~\"Enterprise Applications\" will be creating use cases as part of an investigative spike issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/385#investigative-spike.  \n\n### Proposal\n\nOnce [Orders Harmonization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6641) dev work is complete and the feature has been enabled in CustomersDot staging, ~\"Enterprise Applications\" will create Ramp use cases in Zuora API Sandbox and Zuora Central Sandbox as documented in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/129).  This is estimated to start 2021-11-15, and completed by 2021-11-19.\n\nThe Fulfillment team will observe and document behavior in CustomersDot.  We should be able to start this effort by 2021-11-22.\n\nHere's a list of this we should check:\n- Were callouts received and processed as expected for ramp subscriptions?\n  - Emails delivered?\n  - Offline license generated for 1st year of subscription?\n- Are ramp subscriptions displayed correctly in the \"Manage Subscriptions\" page for customers?\n  - Does the download/copy License function as expected?  It should have created the license for the first year of the subscription's multi-year term.\n- Is support able to manually create licenses effectively for the 2nd year or later of the multi year subscription?\n\nIf anything is found that requires Fulfillment work, we should note it in this issue and notify @teresatison as it could impact the delivery date for Ramps.\n\n### Test Data\nRamps data has been generated in the dev environment (via Zuora API SB 1) for Fulfillment review.

Given the 3-tier model of these orders, the Partner Contact facilitating the purchase of GitLab needs to receive the licensing email in addition to the End User.  For detailed requirements about licensing email updates, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/132).\n\n## Requirements\n\nCustomize the existing license email for e-marketplace orders to send a courtesy cop (cc) the Reseller Contact.\n\n## Scope\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/445\n\n## Proposal\n\n- CustomersDot does have some logic already for resellers.\n  - If a subscription is considered to be managed by a reseller (e.g. `invoice_owner_id != account_id`), then the customer account associated with the subscription will not be allowed to login to CustomersDot.\n  - When the license email is sent to the customer and the subscription is managed by a reseller, a reseller notification email is sent to the reseller. The email used for the reseller is pulled from the work_email of the subscription invoice_owner contact account.\n- The [issue description](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/132#details) states the \"contact is different from the Sell To, Invoice Owner, or Bill To contacts and will most likely not be stored in Zuora\". Given that, it sounds like we would have to fetch this information from SFDC which would be new work. However, the step to create data in SFDC is after this step, so I'm not sure where we should get this information.\n- I'm curious what this means for the existing reseller logic.

This might be my confusion, but I thought the purpose of this issue was to define the transaction from CustomersDot into Zuora. However, the description includes information about Quote-related objects, which I thought were SFDC-related, and that this information would be fed into SFDC after successful entry into Zuora (as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/128).\n- What would be helpful to assess LOE for this issue might be to understand what exactly needs to be sent in the subscribe API request to Zuora.

[This document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hD1xgEyJL1U1eyvTci6NNlCdIur4PkB16GO52wjZRgk/edit#slide=id.g5d8fd53174_0_44) provides more information on how Visual Compliance works today for sales assisted deals.\n\nIf compliance check fails, Arrow needs to be notified of order rejection. If compliance check passes, the order should proceed and data should continue to flow through GitLab's internal systems.\n\n## Requirement\n\nEnsure all Arrowsphere Orders are submitted through Visual Compliance prior to booking.\n\n## Potential Options\n\n### Option 1: Use CDot Existing API\n\n- A pre-requisite to this step will be to [enable VC in CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3393), date TBD.\n- The `ComplianceCheckService` can likely be re-used for the new subscribe API endpoint to be used by Platypus.\n  * Currently the `ComplianceCheckService` is utilized in a `before_action` filter for a few controller actions: customer registration and subscriptions controller actions (new, edit, renew, autorenew).\n- The tricky part will be making sure the input from Arrow matches the expectation for the visual compliance API. It expects 3 parameters: `company`, `country`, `state`. It's difficult to say because we don't have access to docs, but I believe it uses [the ISO_3166 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes).\n- The other piece to sort out is what to do when compliance fails. The requirements say \"Arrow needs to be notified of order rejection\". Are there any more specifics known for this requirement? Is Arrow looking for a specific HTTP code? I'm not sure we need to know all the specifics at this point for estimation, as long as the expected response isn't too involved.\n\n\n### Option 2: Create Platypus Callout\n* The original decision for e-disty implementation was for Platypus to own the compliance check\n* After meeting with Visual Compliance, API setup does seem straightforward \u0026 doable, however there will be an additional cost to proceeding this way\n\n##### Pricing Info\n* Annual price of approximately 12,000 USD given standard 3 year term and leveraging of existing Gitlab/Descartes Visual Compliance master terms\n* One-time $2,500 integration service and activation setup fee for the initial implementation effort which covers a dedicated implementation consultant, sandbox/test environment, and concierge service to ensure solution is up and running as efficiently as possible\n\n## Proposal\n\nAs of June 2 2022, we are leaning towards implementing Option 1, with some alterations.  The original plan for Option 1 was to first enable existing VC solution (as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3393).  The existing VC solution was disabled in production because of a discrepancy between the countries that VC was blocking and the countries that GitLab wanted to block.  However, with v1 of the Distributor e-Marketplace solution with Arrowsphere, we only need to account for US-based orders, making the existing VC API a possibility at least in the short-term.\n\nThe current proposal is to implement and enable VC just for the marketplace API as a short-term solution to be able to release v1.  Long-term, the VC solution in CDot will be replaced with RiskRate.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-25T18:52:38.758Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T19:17:39.694Z","closed_at":"2022-06-17T07:07:37.807Z","closed_by":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Fulfillment Platform","backend","devops::fulfillment","eDisty","group::fulfillment platform","section::fulfillment","type::feature","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"}],"author":{"id":7971452,"username":"teresatison","name":"Teresa Tison","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7971452/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/teresatison"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu Zhao","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4098809/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/qzhaogitlab"},"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3710","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3710","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3710/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3710/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3710","relative":"#3710","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#3710"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":6873,"epic":{"id":365061,"iid":6873,"title":"Integrate with Distributor e-Marketplace (Arrowsphere) to create and provision orders","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6873","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Nov 17, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95692923,"iid":3695,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Backend: Update orders table to set product_rate_plan_id of new OSS plan (for existing orders)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nWe need to update GL.com database to set GitLab subscription hosted_plan_id of `opensource` after the CustomersDot is able to sync `opensource` for Order having a subscription `Plan::ULTIMATE_SAAS_OSS_1_YEAR`.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- [x] Write a rake task to do the following \n     1.

performance of `/gitlab_plans` endpoint","description":"### Problem\nWhen investigating Purchase error spend (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342844), it was observed that the `/gitlab_plans` endpoint is slow to respond. It seems to average locally around 2 seconds with spikes to 5 or more seconds. The latency in this endpoint causes the Billing page in GitLab to frequently take over 5 seconds to load.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSince this endpoint is static and appears to be CPU bound, we should target 500ms or less response time. We should investigate the speed of JSON serialization, etc.\n\nBased on Tyler's assessment [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3677#note_702863713), with him having [fixed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3677#note_705168537) one of the use cases, we just have this one remaining to address:\n\n\u003e If `namespace_id` is provided, it will be used to lookup the related order for that namespace and find the associated subscription in Zuora ([code reference](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/2c3cd06d36ec0a1535fca0ee96b7bfee2b36b052/app/controllers/plans_controller.rb#L34)). Later, the products are also fetched from Zuora and this is a slow process (\\~1.3s on my local machine). This is necessary to determine which plan the namespace is already using, price for upgrades, etc. We will likely need to focus our efforts on ways to improve this lookup.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n\n### How will we measure success?\nEndpoint responds in 500ms or

your laptop to the public Internet. An example of this would be using ngrok to generate a public URL for accessing a local development environment. \n\n### Proposal\n\nReplace ngrok with an indirect proxy that forwards callouts from Zuora without the need to open a port in your computer. A few alternatives I thought of:\n\n- Use https://gitlab.com/jameslopez/zsim to simulate the callouts API by querying the Zuora notifications API\n- Create a proxy server that receives all dev callouts from Zuora and displays a copy \u0026 paste `curl` URL+payload we could replay in our local environment (Okta log in needed into the tool)\n\n### Result\n\nSafe local environments","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-04T09:38:51.024Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T14:50:22.009Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T23:01:09.917Z","closed_by":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Fulfillment Platform","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::fulfillment platform","section::fulfillment","workflow::in review"],"milestone":{"id":2453022,"iid":73,"group_id":9970,"title":"15.1","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T22:23:29.335Z","due_date":"2022-06-17","start_date":"2022-05-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/73"},"assignees":[{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"}],"author":{"id":273486,"username":"jameslopez","name":"James Lopez","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/273486/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jameslopez"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":11167007,"username":"aish.sub","name":"Aishwarya Subramanian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11167007/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aish.sub"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3659","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3659","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3659/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3659/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3659","relative":"#3659","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#3659"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":8458,"epic":{"id":574239,"iid":8458,"title":"Containerized version of CustomersDot","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8458","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 17, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":94705541,"iid":3658,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Replace references to created_at in displaying Purchase Date","description":"### Problem\n\nAs described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3556, in order to support Zuora Orders Harmonization in CustomersDot, we need to remove dependencies to Amendments in the `Product` class.

This error is due to 2 things:\n\n1. The Subscription from the callout was already cancelled so it is not found in the Zuora query because we only find Active Subscriptions [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8cd4b49bb71c00887b5c3dd99bd07b339743d186/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L32).\n1. The SubscriptionTermStart callout must be defined incorrectly in Zuora production.  I noticed the `subscription_id` actually contains a leading space in the XML body which you can see in the Sentry error (see below).  This causes [the fallback query here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8cd4b49bb71c00887b5c3dd99bd07b339743d186/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L33) not to find the subscription either.\n\n    ```\n    \u003cparameter name=\" subscription_id\"\u003e2c92a00e7bde360b017be47e5a335732\u003c/parameter\u003e\n    ```  \n## Proposal\n\nThe `SubscriptionTermStartWorker` can be adjusted to only process subscriptions with a status of \"Active\".

For sales-engaged new biz, the contact that is ultimately passed to Zuora as the Zuora Sold To associated with the Zuora Account and Subscription is used to create or associate a CDot User with a Zuora Account/Subscription.  For Amendment and Renewal sales-engaged deals, no User management takes place in CDot to associate any new contacts with a namespace.  This causes provisioning lags that impact revenue recognition because license emails may not be sent to the appropriate use (that is not represented in CDot or not associated with a namespace/Zuora Subscription).\n\n### Proposal\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/319#note_676389738\n\nUpdate [the `FindOrCreateCustomersService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a370c2b4b1a4fec50a6be2291c7b0ec7c73e0cd7/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L34) to only find Customers using email address.  This means avoid the fallback find logic using `zuora_account_id`.  If new sold to contact information is received in a callout and the email address does not exist, CDot should create a new customer and associate it to the order and account.\n\n### Result\nAll sales-engaged deals have Zuora Sold-To contact created and/or associated with a Zuora Subscription/Account/Namespace.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\nFulfillment (@tgolubeva) and EntApps (@mquitevis) have already brainstormed a high-level solution.  Next steps are Fulfillment prioritization and working on a detailed solution.\n\n### How will we measure success?\nThe Zuora Sold To Contact received licensing emails for all deal types (New business, Amendments, Renewals)\n\n### Communication Plan\n- [x] When problem/solution validation begins, re-engage cross-functional team members: Mark, Jessica, Sarah, Jesse and Tatyana.\n- [~] If and when user design work is deemed necessary and design work starts, communicate the beginning of this development phase.\n- [x] When development work begins, communicate

suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature --\u003e\n\n# Summary\n\n\u003c!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. --\u003e\n\nThis issue is to rollout the new [CI minutes provisioning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5715) on CustomersDot production,\nthat is currently behind the [`new_ci_provisioning`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/102/edit) feature flag.\n\n## Owners\n\n- Team: ~\"group::utilization\" \n- Most appropriate Slack channel to reach out to: `#g_utilization`\n- Best individual to reach out to: `@vij`\n- PM: `@amandarueda` \n\n## The Rollout Plan\n\n- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready\n\nThis feature is running in parallel with existing provisioning and as such is as yet unused on GitLab.com so it can roll out to everyone whilst we monitor and validate the data being created.\n\n## Expectations\n\n### What are we expecting to happen?\n\nWe will expect to start seeing API requests in the Kibana logs, between CustomersDot and GitLab.\n\nThis will result in the creation of `Ci::Minutes::AdditionalPack` records on GitLab when minutes are purchased, and updates to those packs when linked namespaces are changed.\n\n### What might happen if this goes wrong?\n\nWe may see an increase in errors if an unforeseen scenario occurs.\n\nThe result of this would be incorrect data being applied in GitLab.com, the severity of which is low because the data is as yet unused and we have a separate rake task for re-syncing the same data which can always run if/when the problem is resolved.\n\nWe can disable the feature flag safely if this occurs, which will prevent further data creation.\n\n### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?\n\nWe can/should monitor the following after enabling:\n\n**Staging:**\n\n- [#s_fulfillment_status](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL7SX4N86)\n- [Kibana logs for API endpoints](https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net/goto/2b4f611b3e6c912061b19e1502722cf5)\n- [Create packs

Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+transfer)\n\n## Rollout Steps\n\n### Rollout on non-production environments\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.\n- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.\n\n### Preparation before production rollout\n\n- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production\n- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a\n  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).\n  Cross link the issue here if it does.\n- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.\n  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering\n- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated\n- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).\n\n### Global rollout on CustomersDot production\n\n- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident\n- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)\n- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.\n- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.\n- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment \n- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).\n\n### Release the feature\n\nAfter the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),\nthe clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.\n\n\u003c!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status --\u003e\n- [x] Create a merge request to remove `new_ci_provisioning` feature flag\n  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase\n- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production\n- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)\n- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected\n- [x] Remove the [Unleash feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/102/edit)\n- [x] Close this rollout issue.\n\n## Rollback Steps\n\n- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:\n  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/102/edit)","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-16T09:54:52.318Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T08:50:20.162Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T08:50:20.141Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["Unplanned","[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","devops::fulfillment","feature flag","group::utilization","missed:14.3","section::fulfillment","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1948708,"iid":64,"group_id":9970,"title":"14.4","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:44:55.682Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:25:38.537Z","due_date":"2021-10-17","start_date":"2021-09-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/64"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3607","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":23,"completed_count":18},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3607","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3607/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/3607/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3607","relative":"#3607","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#3607"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":5715,"epic":{"id":244743,"iid":5715,"title":"CI Minutes provisioning API Updates","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5715","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Oct 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":93738657,"iid":3605,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Show activation information in the Admin UI","description":"### Problem\n\nAdmins are able to view Cloud Activation data in the Admin UI currently, but the information shown is very basic.

Summary\n\nWe have introduced a new concept of an `Ci::Minutes::AdditionalPack` model on GitLab for handling the new provisioning of CI minutes purchases from CustomersDot.\n\nThis new model has API endpoints that allow us to (re-)sync purchased packs as well as transfer them between namespaces (currently, only when subscriptions are moved).\n\nFurther information is available in the proposal document, [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/doc/ci_minutes/provisioning_proposal.md).\n\nThe current status of this work is that creation and transferring of packs is implemented, but currently un-used on the GitLab side (see the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5715) for more detail).\n\nThis means that CI minutes balance and consumption is still using the old `namespace#extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit`, so although the individual parts are tested at a unit level, we can't easily write E2E tests for this _new_ provisioning yet (someone please correct me if there's a simple way of doing this without UI changes to test against).\n\nSo for now, in order to test the current work end to end, I've created a test plan that I've been working against which I'll document here.\n\nWe can use this plan for checking off scenarios during our manual testing, and eventually using it as a basis for writing automated QA tests.\n\n\n### Setup\n\nAs mentioned above, given there's no UI you can use to verify changes on the GitLab side, we'll need to use a rails console to do it manually, so firstly, here are some (hopefully) useful console snippets for verifying each step:\n\n**Ensure feature flag enabled:\u2028**\n\n```ruby\nUnleash.enabled?(:new_ci_provisioning)\n```\n\nThis is currently [toggled on](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags?scope=featureFlags\u0026page=1) for `customers-development` and `customers-staging` environments.\n\n**Check purchased pack counts on GitLab:**\n\n```ruby\n# Total packs count:\nCi::Minutes::AdditionalPack.count\n\n# a User's packs and count:\nuser.reload\nuser.namespace.ci_minutes_additional_packs\nuser.namespace.ci_minutes_additional_packs.count\nuser.namespace.ci_minutes_additional_packs.sum(\u0026:number_of_minutes)\n\n# a Group's packs and count:\ngroup.reload\ngroup.ci_minutes_additional_packs\ngroup.ci_minutes_additional_packs.count\ngroup.ci_minutes_additional_packs.sum(\u0026:number_of_minutes)\n```\n\n### The Tests:\n\n#### Buying packs:\n\n- **Buy minutes for user**\n    - [ ] Check additional packs count\n    - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n        - **Buy more minutes for User**\n            - [ ] Check additional packs count\n            - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n- **Buy minutes for group**\n    - [ ] Check additional packs count\n    - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n        - **Buy more minutes for group**\n            - [ ] Check additional packs\n            - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n- **Buy subscription for user**\n    - **Buy minutes for user**\n        - [ ] Check additional packs count\n        - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n        - **Buy more minutes for user**\n            - [ ] Check additional packs\n- **Buy subscription for Group**\n    - **Buy minutes for group**\n        - [ ] Check additional packs count\n        - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n        - **Buy more minutes for group**\n            - [ ] Check additional packs count\n            - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n- **Buy minutes for a trial** (`/-/trials/new`)\n  - [ ] Check additional packs count\n  - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n\n#### Transferring packs (`Change linked namespace`):\n\n- **User to Group**\n  - [ ] Check additional packs count on User is zero\n  - [ ] Check additional packs count and number of minutes on Group\n  - **Buy more minutes for Group**\n    - [ ] Check additional packs count\n    - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n- **Group to User**\n  - [ ] Check additional packs on Group is zero\n  - [ ] Check additional packs count and number of minutes on User\n  - **Buy more minutes for User**\n    - [ ] Check additional packs count\n    - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n- **Group to Group**\n  - [ ] Check additional packs on originating Group is zero\n  - [ ] Check additional packs count and number of minutes on target Group\n  - **Buy more minutes for Group**\n    - [ ] Check additional packs count\n    - [ ] Check additional packs number of minutes\n\n\n#### Notes\n\nThe syncing of packs happens asynchronously, so updates may take a few seconds whilst waiting for the Zuora callbacks to be processed.\n\nThere is a [known issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3597) when buying additional minutes for a subscription that has a future dated renewal - these tests will **not currently work** with those subscriptions","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-14T16:05:57.137Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T10:34:32.378Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T10:02:38.482Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay

This is similar to amendment callouts, however there is one big difference.  With Amendments, each Amendment processed yields a new version of the subscription.  This isn't necessarily the case with Order Actions.\n\nWhen processing Amendment callouts in CustomersDot, CustomersDot will only consider a callout if the subscription status is Active in order to avoid provisioning a subscription multiple times.  For instance, if a subscription was upgraded from premium to ultimate, a `RemoveProduct` amendment and `NewProduct` Amendment would be created but only the last Amendment (e.g. NewProduct) would have an \"Active\" subscription status, as that is the latest subscription.\n\nIf we use Order Action callouts, we would need a way to determine the last callout to process and skip the others.  Otherwise, CustomersDot would provision a subscription multiple times.  \n\n### Proposal\n\nInstead of configuring Order Action processed callouts, we should use Order processed callouts.  This would yield only one callout, no matter how many Order Actions were processed, eliminating the step of determining which callout to process.\n\nWe'd have to make some adjustments in callout processing code where `amendment_type` is currently referenced.  Callout params would not contain this parameter.  This would have to be queried from the Order Actions types associated with the Order in Zuora.\n\nFYI, it doesn't look like Orders are supported by IronBank, the gem used in CustomersDot.

[discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3784#note_669109888):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e **suggestion (non-blocking):** Looks like there is an opportunity here for further clean up - follow up.\n    \u003e \n    \u003e I think one easy win will be to remove these `enabled:` key/values + get rid of `enabled_add_ons` and start using `add_ons` directly.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\nConsolidate the `PlansHelper`: `enabled_add_ons` and `add_ons` methods by removing the `enabled` attribute now that is `true` for all cases. Depending on the approach, update the [usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/2373988852a2bd1e3441fc63a11c37bc58161f53/app/views/plans/index.html.haml#L54) of the `enabled_add_ons` with the final method name.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-07T17:15:28.396Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T04:40:57.295Z","closed_at":"2022-09-07T04:40:57.268Z","closed_by":{"id":5667561,"username":"vshumilo","name":"Vladlena Shumilo","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08dfa82785d130c151ab9e21caeab4e3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vshumilo"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::utilization","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":490705,"iid":14,"group_id":9970,"title":"Backlog","description":"Issues that we want to do but are not planned right now.
