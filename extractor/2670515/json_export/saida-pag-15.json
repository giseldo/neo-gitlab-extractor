with gitlab's packages (`@gitlab/ui` and `@gitlab/svgs`) and enable renovate bot to send MRs.\n\nIt could start smaller and safer by enabling the bot to update some of the devDependencies like eslint and all related packages, if all went smoothly for couple weeks then we can increase the volume of the packages being updated regularly.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSetup renovate bot to start sending MRs about updated packages.\n\n### Result\n\nRelatively up to date packages, with smaller changes at a time.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n- Schedule the task at a milestone.\n- Decide which packages to
