But with the current test setup it's hard to use more `let_it_be` and the provided patch added more complexity to it.\n\n### Proposal\nEvaluate to refactor the mentioned specs to remove repetition. Also try to use `let_it_be` to create objects only once and not for each spec. There are a [few suggestions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2847#note_519236368) and a

So here's the issue to suggest this:\n\nWhen looking for the Salesforce account id of a customer and the `salesforce_account_id` field is empty, there is a fallback to the Salesforce contact in place ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/b9203079a4bf620a915c46eca0b9012842dfdccd/app/services/create_salesforce_account_service.rb#L32)). But the customer object is not updated with that information in case the contact returns it.\n\nThis is also the case when creating a new contact as a fallback in the [Salesforce::BaseOpportunityService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b9203079a4bf620a915c46eca0b9012842dfdccd/app/services/salesforce/base_opportunity_service.rb#L29) that is used by `Salesforce::CreateOpportunityService` and `Salesforce::UpdateOpportunityService`.\n\n`@jbrennan1` also [provided this information](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2816#note_515380804):\n\n\u003e a quick overview / thoughts on how SFDC Account, Contact, Opportunity and Opportunity Contact Roles all work:\n\u003e\n\u003e 1. Establish the SFDC Account Id that ALL of the remaining objects will relate up to. @cwiesner the improvement you made to make sure we are ensuring the Account Id is populated looks great! We need to make sure that all steps use the same Account Id.\n\u003e 1. Insert the Contact with AccountId = the Account's Id.\n\u003e 1. Insert the Opportunity with the AccountId = the Account's Id.\n\u003e 1. Insert the Opportunity Contact Role with OpportunityId = Inserted Opp's Id and ContactId = Inserted Contact's Id.\n\u003e\n\u003e Technically parts 2 and 3 can be switched in the order. Tell me if there are any more questions.\n\n### Proposal\nAfter falling back to the Salesforce contact when the customer's `salesforce_account_id` is empty, update it with the contact's `AccountId`.\n\n### Result\nConsistent data and less queries since the field will be updated.\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

This is done as an optimization to reduce the number of requests to Zuora to fetch common products from the catalog.  However, now that we are using [IronBank's local products cache feature](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank#local-records) (with a slight [customization to store in the db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/45f5dedbb4fa803d19827472214ea0b5b0ce1861/lib/gem_extensions/iron_bank/local_records.rb#L6) instead of filesystem), we might not need this eager-loading mechanism anymore.\n\nRemoving eager loading would have some nice benefits:\n- Removes complexity in the app loading logic.\n- Removes a few [class variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/aa13252af0a6e69a58c8ac2bc645afaf36d7b12c/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L12) from our codebase which in general should be avoided.\n- Removes the [eager-loading step](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/fe13e488edc07ced567e0b64d6b560b83b2ccf0d/spec/support/eager_load_plan_finder.rb#L10) from Rspec configuration.  This would be a huge benefit because `plans_finder` has its own VCR cassette for this eager loading that frequently causes merge conflicts since it is a very commonly updated file.  Fixing this should improve our velocity and generally the engineers quality of life.\n\n### Proposal\n\nRemove the `PlansFinder` eager-loading logic and make sure nothing breaks.  The `PlansFinder.find` method could be updated to find a Product Rate Plan directly using IronBank (e.g. `Zuora::ProductRatePlan.find`) rather than looping over `eager_loaded_plans`.  The key difference here is we would build the `Plan` object on the fly instead of returning a `Plan` object that was [built during start up](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/aa13252af0a6e69a58c8ac2bc645afaf36d7b12c/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L31).\n\nWe should take benchmarks of important features before and after this change to make sure there is no negative impact.  Here are some ideas of things to benchmark:\n- Loading the Rails app.\n- Loading the Plans page.\n- Loading the Manage subscriptions page.\n- Making a subscription purchase.\n\n### Result\n\nA simpler codebase that hopefully isn't any less performant but easier to maintain.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-09T17:32:55.884Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T18:41:03.522Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T03:59:13.377Z","closed_by":{"id":280339,"username":"rdavila","name":"Rub√©n

This is a bug.\n\n### Problem\n\nslack discussion https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CMJ8JR0RH/p1612432937066900\n\nTLDR: When a namespace has a free trial and then purchased a paid plan, it will have this issue.\n\nThe problem is: in `app/helpers/gitlab_plans_helper.rb`, it uses `namespace.trial_ends_on.nil?` to determine whether a subscription is `in trial`. This is not safe.\n\n**Snapshot (some namespace with paid subscriptions like g300, is allowing to link to another subscription, which is wrong)** ![Screenshot_from_2021-02-08_09-46-05](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/uploads/1f399fa44f70f1edd5fda900fed8efe6/Screenshot_from_2021-02-08_09-46-05.png)\n\n### Proposal\n\nTLDR: uses `!namespace.trial` to replace `namespace.trial_ends_on.nil?` in `app/helpers/gitlab_plans_helper.rb`\n\n**More details explained below**\n\nThe information we saved for trial subscription:\n\n* trial_starts_on\n* trial\n* trial_ends_on.\n\nIt is not safe to use `trial_ends_on` to determine whether a subscription is `in trial`. Because when a trial finished, `trial_ends_on` value is not cleared.\n\nScenarios related to `trial subscription`:\n\n1. in active trial: `trial = true`, `trial_starts_on \u003c= today`, `trial_ends_on \u003e= today`\n1. trial expired: `trial = true`, `trial_starts_on \u003c= today`, `trial_ends_on \u003c today`\n1. trial terminated due to a paid subscription purchased: `trial = false`, `trial_starts_on \u003c= today`, `trial_ends_on has value ( it \u003e= date when trial was terminated; but while time flies, it will \u003c today eventually)`\n1. trial expired, and then a paid subscription purchased: `trial = false`, `trial_starts_on \u003c= today`, `trial_ends_on \u003c today`\n\nFrom the above-listed scenarios:\n\n* if a namespace's latest subscription is `trial`, it has `trial = true`, no matter the trial expired or not\n* if a namespace's latest subscription is a paid subscription, it has `trial = false`\n\n**NOTE**: today, even when a namespace's trial expired, we still show it as `Trial` in GUI, though the Gold features are disabled since we checked `trial_ends_on` in the logic.\n\nFrom another perspective, in our code logic, as of today, there are 3 types namespaces:\n\n* free : not link to a subscription, no matter trial subscription or paid subscription\n* trial : link to trial subscription(it can be active or expired), but not link to a paid subscription\n* paid subscription : link to a paid subscription\n\nSo if a namespace is linked to a subscription, we can use `trial` to determine it is trial subscripton or paid subscription.\n\n### Result\n\n### Next steps (if any)\n\n### How will we measure success?","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-02-09T00:47:38.248Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T11:14:18.259Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T00:28:55.452Z","closed_by":{"id":4098809,"username":"qzhaogitlab","name":"Qingyu

This has increased user confusion (pre-existing issue) over how to cancel their subscription.\n\nIn the subscription header, it states the expiration date which implies it will cancel but I think we need something more eye-catching.\n\nIn this iteration, I'd like to ship a quick solution to the CustomersDot subscription card for subscriptions set to cancel. This should be applicable to all subscriptions which are not set to autorenew, not just Bronze/Starter.\n\nPerhaps a colored badged that says \"cancelled\" and when you hover over it there is text along the lines of \"this subscription will not automatically renew and will cancel on the expiration date. Please select the renew button to continue your subscription for another year.\" ... ish?\n\nI'm totally open to alternative ideas, whatever it is, would be good to ship

think there's space for some simplification (e.g., separating the concern of having a `selectedUpgrade` and `updatingPreviewData`) and especially for leveraging Vue reactivity.\n    \u003e \n

In the past we also introduced a class method on the `Subscription` model called `current_subscription` which finds the current rate plans and rate plan charges for a given subscription (but didn't find the current subscription version).  It was our intention when that class method was introduced to go back when we were able to find the current subscription version and incorporate that logic.\n\nThe following discussion from !2460 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @tyleramos started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2460#note_481241444): \n\n    \u003e I was thinking that once we had the strategy for getting the current version of the subscription, we could incorporate that into [the `Subscription.current_subscription` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/7db573eb22a7f877e9ea4eaa6a442499f16d7b11/app/models/subscription.rb#L31).  When we did that, we could use that here if we wanted (but not sure if it makes sense).  This sounds like a good candidate for a follow-up issue.  I'll go ahead and create it, assuming you are on-board with it, but let me know if you have concerns.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-08T17:07:21.642Z","updated_at":"2021-01-24T12:18:53.887Z","closed_at":"2021-01-24T12:18:53.809Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Provision","backend","devops::fulfillment","group::utilization","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2483","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2483","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2483/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2483/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2483","relative":"#2483","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#2483"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76930384,"iid":2482,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Unable to Reset Password in GitLab Customer Portal","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"bug\" label in relevant trackers:\n\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug\n\nand verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n\nDo not include confidential information!\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nAn existing GitLab customer cannot reset their password in the GitLab customer portal from within their account.

Due to this, trying to update the `perform_reconciliations__c` field from the CustomersDot app fails.\n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Create a new custom field in production Zuora with the same details as https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/CustomField.do?method=viewDetail\u0026id=2c92c0f87688a09601768ac3019f7cc5\u0026objectType=Subscription. Note that the field label is  `Perform reconciliations1?` on sandbox just to visually distinguish it from the existing custom field during testing. On production Zuora, the label can be `Perform reconciliations?`.\n\n1. Update the CustomersDot app to use the new custom field and remove the old (`perform_reconciliations__c`) one.\n\n1. Delete the existing `perform_reconciliations__c` field once the production CustomersDot app has been updated.\n\n#### Steps\n\n- [X] Add new custom field to Zuora sandbox.\n- [X] Add new custom field to sandbox schema files - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2443.\n- [x] Remove old custom field from sandbox schema files - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2502.\n- [x] Remove the old custom field from Zuora sandbox.\n- [x] Observe staging to see if there are any problems.\n- [x] Remove old custom field from production schema files - !2613.\n- [x] Ask `@mquitevis` to rename the custom field in production Zuora.\n- [x] Add the new custom field to production schema files: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2688\n\n### Result\n\nThe CustomersDot app is able to update the value of the `PerformReconciliations__c` field.\n\n\u003c!-- ### Next steps (if any) --\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- ### How will we measure success? --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-05T10:15:53.793Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T11:04:59.908Z","closed_at":"2021-01-29T11:04:59.837Z","closed_by":{"id":2967854,"username":"rpereira2","name":"Reuben Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2967854/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rpereira2"},"labels":["Category:Purchase","devops::fulfillment","group::purchase","missed:13.8","section::fulfillment","workflow::in dev"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":2967854,"username":"rpereira2","name":"Reuben Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2967854/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rpereira2"}],"author":{"id":2967854,"username":"rpereira2","name":"Reuben Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2967854/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rpereira2"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2967854,"username":"rpereira2","name":"Reuben Pereira","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2967854/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rpereira2"},"user_notes_count":23,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2463","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":8},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2463","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2463/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2463/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2463","relative":"#2463","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#2463"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":76743655,"iid":2462,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Stop converting symbols to strings in Zuora::Resource","description":"The following discussion from !2414 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @tyleramos started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2414#note_473217243): \n\n    \u003e Nice catch with this!

customer has at least one active subscription.  However, this method using the following logic, which queries for all subscriptions in Zuora, then subsequently all rate plans and rate plan charges, and initializes `Subscription` objects for each one.  This is very inefficient, especially for customers with more than one subscription.\n\n```\n  def current_customer_has_subscription?\n    return unless current_customer\n\n    SubscriptionsFinder.for_customer(current_customer).present?\n  end\n```\n\nThis seems like an easy win to speed up almost all our page loads because this helper is called in the navigation partial which is used in the application layout (IOW most pages).\n\n### Proposal\n\nInstead of using `SubscriptionsFinder`, here are a few alternatives:\n\n- A simple fix would be to pull `raw_subscriptions` directly from the customer and return if any are found.  This bypasses the queries for rate plans rate plan charges.  This could be something like: `current_customer.raw_subscriptions.any?`.\n- Even better would be to limit the query to Zuora to only pull the first subscription.  Something like `current_customer.raw_subscriptions(limit: 1).any?`.  This would require a few modifications but IronBank supports limits in `where` (e.g. `Zuora::Subscription.where({status: 'Active', account_id: cus.zuora_account_id}, limit: 1)`.\n\n###

For example, purchasing a new Bronze plan to replace the expired Gold plan is not possible.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHave a group with an expired subscription, but which is still within the grace period before the system automatically downgrades the group to Free.  Attempt a new purchase workflow from customerDot, which redirects to gitlab.com/susbcriptions. The dropdown when choosing a group for the new subscription is not populated with desired group\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nCustomer should be able to make a new purchase for a group with an expired subscription\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n1. Customer has 3 groups, one of which is currently on Gold with expired subscription:\n\n![groups-in-cd-admin](/uploads/cb742a718edfc6e1216826c2b7e94320/groups-in-cd-admin.png)\n\n2. From customers.gitlab.com, when attempting to purchase a new plan, the workflow redirects to `gitlab.com/subscriptions` and the form only displays 2 groups, neither are the desired group:\n\n![new-workflow](/uploads/798787d697b430b8086118fc967410ae/new-workflow.png)\n\n3. There are no available plans for purchase when viewing group billing page:\n\n![dotcom-billing](/uploads/5a7678f87301c39ed50be570b998bff2/dotcom-billing.png)\n\n\n**However**, Circumventing the new process (see below) shows the group with the expired subscription as available for applying a new purchase:\n\n![cd-workflow](/uploads/e7cec93ab357447fef6f0a5a28e7452f/cd-workflow.png)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nCircumventing the redirect to gitlab.com and going directly to the customerDot URL and entering the `plan_id` allows the purchase to continue from customers.gitlab.com, and the group is available.  For example, bronze plan id `2c92a0ff5a840412015aa3cde86f2ba6`:\n\n`https://customers.gitlab.com/subscriptions/new?plan_id=2c92a0ff5a840412015aa3cde86f2ba6\u0026transaction=create_subscription`\n\nPurchase workflow can then continue directly from customerDot.\n\nAlternatively, manually downgrading the group to free should also allow the new purchase to proceed.\n\n### Reported examples\n\n1.

There you can see the POST attempting to create the branch `test_test` and then a reply back when querying `/api/:version/internal/allowed` with a status code of 401\n\nThe error message in UI was:\n![image](/uploads/bf0d88b6dd94d90d81491436b3356da2/image.png)\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAn admin user can manually adjust [storage limit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/account_and_limit_settings.html#how-it-works) for the specific project.\n\n### Reported examples\n\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/182522 \n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/185258\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/184715\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/186346\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/185306\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/186907\n1. https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/190409\n\n\u003c!---\nPlease add both severity and priority level according to: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels\n---\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-12-03T16:23:27.093Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T17:05:30.067Z","closed_at":"2021-02-09T17:29:53.080Z","closed_by":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"labels":["[deprecated] Category:Utilization","backend","customer","devops::fulfillment","group::utilization","section::fulfillment","type::bug","workflow::production"],"milestone":{"id":1233760,"iid":56,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.9","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-09T17:44:14.334Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:21:28.468Z","due_date":"2021-02-17","start_date":"2021-01-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/56"},"assignees":[{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"}],"author":{"id":7272738,"username":"kategrechishkina","name":"Kate Grechishkina","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7272738/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kategrechishkina"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5249152,"username":"vij","name":"Vijay Hawoldar","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14567a8b4af4374011c43778878de399?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/vij"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2303","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2303","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2303/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2303/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2303","relative":"#2303","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#2303"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":75550798,"iid":2301,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Support more than one true up SKU","description":"\u003c!--¬†The¬†first¬†four¬†sections:¬†\"Problem¬†to¬†solve\",¬†\"Intended¬†users\", \"User experience goal\",¬†and¬†\"Proposal\",¬†are¬†strongly¬†recommended,¬†while¬†the¬†rest¬†of¬†the¬†sections¬†can¬†be¬†filled¬†out¬†during the problem validation or breakdown phase.

Background\n\nZuora sandbox has been maintained separately from Zuora production for a while.  The product catalog in Zuora sandbox does not reflect that of Zuora production, both in the amount of products offered and the structure of the products, rate plans, and rate plan charges.\n\nFor example, many of the support plans (sold via sales-assisted deals) are not part of sandbox, and therefore are not listed in [the `config/application.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/a7e53acf6a9c04c20be85de28175433e36d6a690/config%2Fapplication.yml).  Any plans like this are not covered in automated tests and not able to be tested manually.\n\nAlso, the structure of the product catalog is different which can lead to confusion.  For example, the Silver Plan is [listed here in Sandbox](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/Product.do?method=view\u0026id=2c92c0f85aac66b3015aaea7163344f7) as a top-level product.  However, it is nested inside of [the Product \"GitLab.com\" in production](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Product.do?method=view\u0026id=2c92a0fe5a83f009015aa3ccb71426ff).\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this issue is to clean-up these inconsistencies and allow us to test all types of products that are supported in Production.  This will require a lot of coordination with engineers to pull off successfully as Sandbox is used by engineers for local development/testing, CI, and Staging.\n\nNote: There is a related task, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/655, to create a production-copy for sandbox.\n\n## Follow-up from:\n\nThe following discussion from !2257 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @tyleramos started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2257#note_453002903):  (+2 comments)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-24T17:50:03.895Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T00:01:48.676Z","closed_at":"2022-02-25T00:01:48.669Z","closed_by":{"id":1786152,"username":"gitlab-bot","name":"ü§ñ GitLab Bot ü§ñ","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1786152/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-bot"},"labels":["auto closed","auto updated","devops::fulfillment","maintenance::refactor","section::fulfillment","zuora"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4159190,"username":"tyleramos","name":"Tyler Amos","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4159190/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tyleramos"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2258","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2258","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2258/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515/issues/2258/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/2670515","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2258","relative":"#2258","full":"gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#2258"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":74918458,"iid":2254,"project_id":2670515,"title":"Evaluate using TransactionLineItem vs extracting invoice item to its own component","description":"We've some repeated code in `renew subscription form`, `dotcom subscription form` and in `add seats invoice` where we show the invoice data.\n\nWe need to consider using [`TransactionLineItem`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/4b10b9b77811eb6d2da74f7d13d40dedd7212419/app/frontend/javascripts/purchase/components/transaction_line_item.vue) vs extracting the repeated code into its own component.\n\nThe idea started in [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2197#note_453393036) from !2197 \n\n### `TransactionLineItem`\n\n```\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003chr v-if=\"topBorderEnabled\" class=\"gl-my-5\" /\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"gl-display-flex gl-justify-content-space-between\"\u003e\n      \u003cstrong data-testid=\"label\"\u003e{{ label }}\u003c/strong\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"gl-my-auto\"\u003e\n        \u003cgl-loading-icon v-if=\"isLoading\" /\u003e\n        \u003cspan v-else-if=\"value\" data-testid=\"value\"\u003e{{ value }}\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv v-if=\"description \u0026\u0026 !isLoading\" data-testid=\"description\" class=\"text-muted gl-mt-3\"\u003e\n      {{ description }}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n![Screenshot_2020-11-24_at_15.39.36](/uploads/95b0cec30d518b467b9ea98bd440b0fe/Screenshot_2020-11-24_at_15.39.36.png)\n\n\n### [what's used in the renew transactions]\n\n```\n\u003cdiv class=\"d-flex justify-content-between py-3 border-top border-light\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3 class=\"gl-text-black-normal gl-my-auto\"\u003eSub-total\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cgl-loading-icon v-if=\"isLoading\" inline /\u003e\n  \u003cp v-else-if=\"subTotal\" class=\"gl-text-gray-900 gl-font-lg gl-my-auto\"\u003e\n    {{ formatMoney(subTotal) }}\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n\n\u003c!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.\n\nWhat risks does this change pose to our availability?

Once the applicant is approved, they will receive a coupon code and be prompted to self-checkout on customers.gitlab.com to complete the subscriptions creation and provisioning processes.\n\n### Process overview\n1. Upon approval, the applicants receive a coupon code\n1. The applicant navigates to customers.gitlab.com, selects new subscription flow\n1. User enters the code at checkout and the subscription is booked at $0.00\n     1. The subscription must be created using the applicable Community Programs sku\n     1. The user should not be prompted to enter a credit card since the net is $0.00\n1. Normal provision process follows\n\n### Coupon Code Generator Features\n1. We need to store the generated codes so they can be referenced during checkout\n1. The coupon code should relate to product sku (info received from the vendor call) which when applied to a purchase flow, would dictate which product sku we are selling\n1. The code can not be reused; once redeemed, we invalidate the code in our DB for future use\n1. The code will provide a specific discount per sku\n1. The vendor presenting the coupon code after successful application cannot utilize an API to receive the coupon from us. We will need to provide the vendor with bulk codes via a file upload periodically.\n\n## Tasks\n\n1. [ ] Introduce the Coupon Code on the FE (New subscription flow)\n     1. There is a coupon code field which was hidden via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/662; let's just reveal that field again.\n1. [ ] Build the coupon code generator\n1. [ ] Build BE logic to recognize coupon code\n1. [ ] Determine how to handle Renewal Process\n1.
