[{"id":98557810,"iid":3104,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Consider a private meltano managed `.meltano/dbt/profiles.yml` for dbt","description":"## Background\n\nCurrently Meltano creates a not-very robust `profiles.yml` file which attempts to be \"one size fits all\" but it only supports a few different config options and has several magic environment variables it expects. This is a barrier to new users onboarding and frequently we get \"not declared\" errors for those environment variables being missing from runtime context.\n\nPros of status quo:\n\n1. Gives an out-of-box dbt experience for three different generic database configs: postgres, redshift, and snowflake\n    - https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-dbt/-/blob/master/bundle/transform/profile/profiles.yml\n2. Doesn't require a user to understand the `profiles.yml` format.\n\nCons of status quo:\n\n1. Most users will end up deleting the extra profiles or modifying the file to make it their own. (Which feels wrong, like you are breaking the connection to Meltano.)\n1. There's no support for other databases like Spark or Redshift.\n1. Manual changes could get overridden if the files bundle is reinstalled.\n1. Following from point 1, it's not clear at all if overriding/modifying the built-in `profiles.yml` is supported - or if there are other consequences of doing so.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Similarly to how Meltano pre-creates and manages config.json files and catalog.json files for taps, Meltano could auto-generate a hidden `profiles.yml` file internally to the `.meltano` directory.\n1. Meltano can populate values from config in `meltano.yml`, rather than requiring special environment variables to be set by the user.\n1. Meltano can pick what kind of dbt adapter to use based on the environment's `primary_loader` config (not yet built).\n1. As users get more mature in their usage of dbt, they may _optionally_ provide a path to their own generated profiles.yml file. This could be an optional config option for the `dbt` transformer and/or of the meltano environment itself.\n1. The user can optionally provide a profile name for dbt to use - as a config option for the `dbt` transformer.\n    - If not set, the dbt profile target can default to the environment name (`prod`, `userdev`, etc.).\n1. Since the hidden file would not be version controlled, it can be adapted without breaking existing code. For instance, we could add handling for a Spark profile and we wouldn't need users to reinstall `files-dbt` bundle.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-06T22:40:00.303Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T09:59:52.072Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T09:59:52.040Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Transform","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351601,"iid":210,"group_id":2524164,"title":"June 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-06-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/210"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3104","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3104","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3104/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3104/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3104","relative":"#3104","full":"meltano/meltano#3104"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":82,"epic":{"id":102873,"iid":82,"title":"Improved dbt integration","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/82","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":98540152,"iid":3101,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Document pyenv/poetry use in contributor docs","description":"Our getting started guide for contributors isn't super cohesive in how the setup steps for contributing to meltano, the meltano api, or the meltano ui are described, and what the expected dev environment looks like.\n\n1.

If a loader fails in an ELT job, what happens to the data and the state?  I reviewed the Meltano ELT reference architecture and it does not say, and I have not looked at the source.  Is the main Meltano process actually sitting in the middle and watching the messages from extractor stdout and sending them to loader stdin, and watching stdout of the target for that state to know that the target has processed, and stored, records up to that state?  I've had that assumption all along, but didn't really know.\n\n\u003e I know the feeling. It's one of those things that you really want to know is solid and understand, but I've also often had the feeling I didn't really understand what would happen in exceptional situations.\nTaking the code is truth approach - these are the relevant places I think:\nhttps://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/singer/target.py#L21\nhttps://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/runner/singer.py#L90\nAs each STATE message flows through, meltano (or optionally delegated to the target it seems) writes the state.\nWould be great to have one of the @meltano-engineering guys jump in and correct me, or even some links to detailed design docs!

This enables users to benefit from Meltanos config, virtual-env and environment management features in a simple and intuitive way (i.e. without having to prefix each plugin invocation with `meltano invoke`).\n\n### Target audience\n\nDevelopers, Data Engineers, Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers working within a Meltano Project.\n\n### Further details\n\nThis would compliment the recently added `--environments` [feature](https://meltano.com/docs/environments.html#environments), allowing users to get on with _using_ wrapped tools without having to worry about configuration, virtual-env and dev/prod environment differences. It also cuts down on redundant setup/teardown operations on each `meltano invoke` invocation (e.g. Airflow `initdb` [here](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/airflow.py#L108)), and allows us to set up other convenience features like autocomplete etc. in the shell context. Users may wish to have control of the development environment for each plugin, including adding additional tools for tests, linting etc. (e.g. SQLFluff with dbt).\n\nThis may also be an opportunity to support Docker containers for development. `meltano shell` may just as easily implement an equivalent of `docker run -it fishtownanalytics/dbt` as `source /path/to/dbt/venv/bin/activate`. This may reduce the impact of cross-platform tooling support and configuration differences.\n\n### Proposal\n\nExample workflow for adding a new data integration using Meltano, dbt and Airflow:\n\n```shell\n$ git checkout -b 2345_add_gitlab_to_hub_pipeline\n\n# find a tap that matches the source I want to integrate\n$ meltano discover extractors\n\u003e tap-gitlab\n\u003e ...\n\n# add and configure the tap\n$ meltano add extractor tap-gitlab\n$ meltano config tap-gitlab set projects \"meltano/meltano meltano/sdk\"\n$ meltano config tap-gitlab set start_date 2021-10-01T00:00:00Z\n\n# now lets create a schedule\n$ meltano schedule gitlab-to-postgres tap-gitlab target-postgres @daily\n\n# and run a sample extract in my development environment, so dbt has data\n$ meltano --environment=dev_kp elt tap-gitlab target-postgres --job_id=gitlab-to-postgres\n\n# with a new extractor added and data extracted,\n# lets update our dbt models for the new source...\n\n# activate a console within the 'dbt' virtual env created by Meltano Project,\n# using secrets/env vars from my personal dev environment\n$ meltano shell dbt --environment=dev_kp\n\n# luckily a postgres-compatible dbt package exists for the tap I just added 😅\n$ nano packages.yml\n\u003e packages:\n  - package: dbt-labs/gitlab\n    version: 0.7.0\n\n$ dbt deps\n\n# run the new package using creds from my dev_kp environment\n$ dbt run --select gitlab \n\n# done (optimistically)\n$ exit\n\u003e back in parent project context\n\n# finally, lets update my hub DAG in Meltano Project (doesn't exist yet - see [#2920](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2920))\n$ nano meltano.yml\n\u003e ...\ndags:\n  meltano_hub:\n    interval: @daily\n    steps:\n      - name: gitlab\n        cmd: 'meltano elt tap-gitlab target-postgres --job_id=gitlab-to-postgres'\n        retries: 2\n      - name: google_analytics\n        cmd: 'meltano elt tap-google-analytics target-postgres --job_id=google-analytics-to-postgres'\n      - name: product_mart\n        cmd: 'meltano invoke dbt run --select models/marts/product'\n        depends_on:\n          - gitlab\n          - google_analytics\n...\n\n# wonder if the new DAG actually works?\n# start a terminal session in the Airflow context\n$ meltano shell airflow --environment=dev_kp\n# Note: this could launch a local instance of `airflow webserver`\n# for developer convenience 🤔\n\n$ airflow dags list\n\u003e meltano_hub\n\n$ airflow dags trigger meltano_hub\n\u003e runs DAG locally using config specified in dev_kp environment\n\n# *goes and checks the Airflow UI on http://localhost:8080 and the test warehouse for data*\n\n# done\n$ exit\n\n# lets see what the team thinks\n$ git commit -am \"added gitlab integration\"\n$ git push\n$ glab mr create\n# off it goes to CI ✉️\n\n# profit ☕️\n```\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers can work productively in a plugins context facilitated (and not obstructed) by Meltano Project. New users to a Project do not need to worry about the mechanics of installation and configuration; onboarding to an existing Project is as easy as `git clone` and `meltano shell \u003cplugin name\u003e` 🚀\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links / references\n\n- [#2920](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2920) Meltano should output a DAG-like data structure with individual pipeline components\n- [\u002682](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/epics/82) Improved dbt integration\n- [#2210](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2205) Add `docker_image` property to support non-Python/pip plugins\n\n_Please note that this was taken from GitLab, to be changed accordingly_\n\n## Option: Alternative framing around `meltano environment activate ...`\n\nWe should consider also if this could be an environment-level invocation, such as `meltano environment activate`. Which would be a much more robust version of sourcing the `.env` variables, but able to step into a context where all invocations are already contextualized and able to be invoked directly.\n\nIf an environment-level action, we get around issues of having to step separately into dbt and sqlfluff context separately, because all of the context for both would be set at time of activating the environment.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-16T13:22:57.314Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T09:55:15.915Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T09:55:15.897Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty

This was a bit of a red herring or more a side effect - with the command simply complaining that the state file couldn't be read. When in reality the state capability wasn't being advertised by the plugin and so no state file was even being produced. \n\nWhile investigating that we realized the `meltano elt --dump=state` wasn't actually hitting the system db directly. It indirectly makes a bare `_invoke()` call using [plugin_invoker.dump](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin_invoker.py#L288), which behind the scenes triggers the [look_up_state_hook](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/singer/tap.py#L165) - which in turn tries to read the state from the db, and if successful then [writes out the state to the state file](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/singer/tap.py#L246). After `_invoke()` completes, dump just tries to the read state file.\n\n1. If we can deprecate/phase out the use of a state file, we could just update have the dump pull the state straight from the system db and go ahead and simplify the code in the tap ditching the state file generation code. \n2. If we need to continue generating the state file - dump could still do that - but we'd definitely want to refactor dump and look_up_state_hook to share some code. \n\nWith either path, a single consolidated look_up_state method for both the tap and dump to use is probably the move.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-09T19:20:44.213Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T09:54:23.922Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T09:54:23.883Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["kind::Tech Debt","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351601,"iid":210,"group_id":2524164,"title":"June 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-06-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/210"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":22132,"username":"pandemicsyn","name":"Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/88529f59d3f298bcc9e2a705dc1f1c68?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pandemicsyn"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3054","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3054","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3054/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3054/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3054","relative":"#3054","full":"meltano/meltano#3054"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":142,"epic":{"id":502327,"iid":142,"title":"`meltano state` management improvements","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/142","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":96974985,"iid":3052,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Meltano should print a warning if any of these are missing from capabilities: (`state`, `discover`, (`catalog` XOR `properties`))","description":"There are enough instances of expensive debug operations at this point (most recently [today](https://meltano.slack.com/archives/CKHP6G5V4/p1636419311194200?thread_ts=1636399782.175500\u0026cid=CKHP6G5V4)), that I think we should be printing an explicit warning message whenever any of these capabilities are not found in `discovery.yml`:\n\n1.

That's a simpler problem because we don't have release notes and the version number is just an auto-generated `dev` bump using the CI build number.\n \nOpening this issue to figure out how we get to similar simplicity for normal deployments.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Continue frequent releases.\n2. Reduce cost to dev productivity.\n3. Make dual-channel releases (`edge`/`main`) more viable, as proposed in https://gitlab.com/meltano/meta/-/issues/135\n\n## Statu Quo\n\nHere are the current manual deployments steps (excluding marketing/slack/tweets, etc.):\n\n1. Open a release branch. (Triggers an auto-commit with the version bump.)\n2. Open a tag from the release branch. (Triggers the PyPi publish.)\n3. Groom the changelog. (Can be performed before, after, or in parallel with the above - since the changelog itself is not shipped.)\n\n## Ideal State\n\n### Changelog automation\n\nI don't know as much about this space but I believe there are some available options.\n\n### One-Step version bump, validation, and publish\n\nRather than requiring the tag to be created explicitly in a separate step, we can modify the CI pipeline to _also_ run the publish step in the special CI job that runs when a new branch is created like `release/*`.\n\nThe special CI pipeline for `release/*` tags can be removed in favor of the branch pipeline, to eliminate the need for a second step, and avoid \"chaining\" of auto-commits and CI jobs. We could still create the tag as part of the CI pipeline, rather than as a manual step.\n\n### Proposed flow\n\nReleases:\n\n1. As release manager, I create a correctly-named release branch which triggers the release pipeline.\n2. I click \"Merge when pipeline succeeds\" immediately - meaning, a successful CI run (including publish steps) will close out the version bump.\n\nChange Log Grooming:\n\n1.

This would resolve all dependencies, including the `discovery.yml` ref and combination of all `include-path` files for multi-meltano files.\n\nIn future iterations this could be expanded to:\n\n3. Include `catalog.json` caches.\n4. Resolve all config representations of `environments` so that each environment has a fully resolved schema (_except_ secrets and the content of any externally-managed environment variables.)~~ - Not needed in initial release.\n5. Optionally, include rich information of the DAG structure for known/declared pipelines or schedules.\n\nBased on this lock file artifact, external tools such as Terraform, Databand, etc. could build environments and/or obtain rich project metadata needed for integration.\n\nThis may also provide improved stability projects for projects running in the wild, as discussed in this comment: https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/epics/128#note_734475476\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Alternate implementation option (2022-02-10)\n\nHere's an alternative that just focuses on freezing the plugin definitions, ideally copying those verbatim from their source of truth on hub.meltano.com\n\n#### Stable Installations via `meltano add`\n\nWe alter how `meltano add` installs new plugins:\n\n1. Instead of installing directly from `discovery.yml` and relying on the `discovery.yml` definition for resolution, we go to https://hub.meltano.com and download the file associated with the plugin.\n2. The downloaded definition file will be installed into `${MELTANO_PROJECT_DIR}/plugins/` as `${MELTANO_PROJECT_DIR}/plugins/extractors/tap-mytap--variantname.yml`.\n3. An optional `plugin_definitions_path: \u003cstr\u003e` config option in `meltano.yml` will allow users to change the default path. This would simply default to `${MELTANO_PROJECT_DIR}/plugins` if not set by the user.\n    - This is separate from [include_paths](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/project#multiple-yaml-files) in `meltano.yml`, since (1) we need to know exactly where to download new definitions and (2) the plugin definition files adhere to a new plugin spec format and not to the `meltano.yml` project format.\n4. After downloading the definition, the plugin entry will be added to `meltano.yml` exactly as is performed today.\n5. Instead of resolving setting definitions via `discovery.yml`, `meltano.yml` will only refer to the downloaded definitions.\n    - This will require a one-time update to our parser to also interpret and import data from the native/standard plugin definitions from hub.meltano.com.\n\n#### Definition updates via `meltano add --upgrade`\n\nWe add something like `meltano add extractor tap-mytap --upgrade` which will replace the current definition with the new definition.\n\n#### Migration to locked definitions via `meltano install --lock` or `meltano install --freeze`\n\nFor projects already in the wild, we can add a `--lock` or `--freeze` option to `meltano install` which generates a \"locked\" plugin definition file for any which are missing. As above, this would create one file per plugin used in the project. If a plugin definition already exists, we skip adding that file.\n\n#### \"Single-file option\"\n\nI think we've declined this option so I'm collapsing it. Please sound off in comments if you have a strong preference otherwise.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n~~As an alternative to downloading and adding files individually, we could follow basically the same behavior as described, except we import/merge definitions in a single file called something at the root of the Meltano project dir like `plugins-registry.yml`, `registered-plugins.yml`, or `plugins-definitions.yml`. Since it would be a single file, we could have it at a fixed path relative to the root, and perhaps in the future allow the user to specify their own path to that file.\n\n(AJ Speaking) I'm personally less inclined towards the single-lock file approach after thinking on this more. The one-file-per-plugin approach creates cleaner file diffs and is more scalable for a large number of plugins.~~\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n#### Deprecating `discovery.yml`\n\nAfter implementing this proposal, `discovery.yml` as it exists today would be fully deprecated. Projects which have not yet had their definitions locked would still fall back to the bundled `discovery.yml` file. For the purposes of not breaking users on older versions, we would simply leave the online version of this file (https://discovery.meltano.com/discovery.yml) frozen at a point in time without needing to continue maintaining updates in `discovery.yml`.\n\n#### Spec versioning\n\nAs @aphethean calls out in a thread on this issue https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3031#note_842196683, we also need to handle spec versioning so that the file spec can evolve without breaking users.\n\nFor instance, @aphethean provides a sample used by Kubernetes (`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`) and we can see something similar in `dbt`'s use of `config-version: 2`.\n\nThis makes sure we meet this requirement as expressed in the comment:\n\n\u003e 1. ‘meltano add extractor tap-csv’\n\u003e 1. Aeons later, tap-csv plugin definition will always work with my meltano project.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-28T20:12:20.489Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T20:25:44.404Z","closed_at":"2022-05-13T01:04:46.498Z","closed_by":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

on input variables for `terraform-meltano-aws` and similar IAC modules","description":"As a follow-on from the conversation in #2987 (internal), I thought it would be helpful to start discussing what configuration levels would be built into our Meltano IAC module for Terraform. To be sure that we have a specific-enough proposal without getting overwhelmed, I think we can describe this in AWS constructs _first_ and later translate these into the relevant constructs for GCP, Azure, etc.\n\n## Functional data project configuration\n\nThese inputs drive core functionality of the Meltano project:\n\n- `meltano_project_file` (str) - The path to a `meltano.yml` file to use in configuration of the environment. This would be [parsed by terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/functions/yamldecode.html) and may affect which resources Terraform creates, and how many. (Altering `meltano.yml` may require rerunning `terraform apply`.)\n- `meltano_project_dir` (str) - The path to the Meltano project folder containing job definitions, dbt transforms, etc.\n- `meltano_environment_name` (str) - The name of the environment to deploy, corresponding to a key in the `environments` entry in `meltano.yml`. This drives environment variable names and other configs as needed for the chosen environment. \n- `project_shortname` (str) - When AWS resources are created, they will be created with this text in the resource name.\n- `aws_region` (required, str) - The region ID (e.g. `us-east-2`)\n\nTo keep the config DRY, most/all other configuration would ideally be migrated into _either_ the `environments` feature in `meltano.yml` _or_ the base plugin or utility config. Then `meltano.yml` (and possibly also `discovery.yml`) would be read as an input to the Terraform module's configuration.\n\n## Optional, AWS infrastructure reuse and interop:\n\nThese inputs are all optional, and they allow the Terraform module to reuse existing AWS resources if desired:\n\n- `use_existing_vpc_id` (optional, str) - The existing VPC ID to use. If null, a new VPC will be created.\n- `use_existing_private_subnets` (optional, list(str)) - The existing private subnets to use. If null, a new VPC will be created.\n- `use_existing_public_subnets` (optional, list(str)) - The existing private subnets to use. If null, a new VPC will be created.\n- `use_existing_s3_logging_path` (optional, str) - The S3 path to use for logging purposes, when S3 log location is needed. If not provided, a new S3 bucket will be created.\n- `use_existing_s3_artifacts_path` (optional, str) - The S3 path to use for storing temporary and long-term internal project artifacts, such as lambda function definitions, zip artifacts, and other internal project file storage. If not provided, a new S3 bucket will be created.\n\nThere may be more here but generally the config would follow the same pattern. In the first iterations, these may be all automatic - meaning we may not at first allow reusing existing resources. However, as the module matures, it should accept an increasing amount of interop and reuse with other environments, either for reasons of cost savings (RDS, K8 cluster, etc.) or corporate compliance policies (subnets, logging bucket, etc.). Most of these resources are free or have negligible cost, so probably would not need to prioritize reuse except for compliance reasons and for interop with existing application infrastructure.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-25T06:08:14.807Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T09:49:21.660Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T09:49:21.643Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Discussion","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":797629,"iid":42,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Backlog","description":"As a start, I think it would be good to prioritize based on:\r\n- urgency of getting feedback\r\n- relative implementation difficulty\r\n- symbiotic relationships between issues","state":"active","created_at":"2019-02-21T14:50:28.741Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T14:50:28.741Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2019-02-25","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3014","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3014","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3014/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3014/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3014","relative":"#3014","full":"meltano/meltano#3014"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":124,"epic":{"id":348329,"iid":124,"title":"Deploying Meltano","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/124","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":95910043,"iid":3001,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Always print `--log-level=debug` guidance after failure","description":"In slack we are often providing the guidance that people can rerun their pipelines with `--log-level=debug` - generally needed when a tap or target cannot properly configure itself or fails auth.\n\nWhat do folks think about _always_ printing this after failure?\n\nSomething like:\n\n\u003e .... has failed.

(#1673) \n\nThe proposed change is to add `jobs` construct, with one or more steps - similar to the proposal of a multi-step `meltano run` but stored in the yaml file and able to be scheduled.\n\nThis is essentially the translation of `meltano run` and `meltano invoke` statements into a DAG definition. Importantly, though, we need to be mindful of how much complexity we want to introduce.\n\nInstead of what we have now that is restricted to just EL pairs:\n\n- A schedule has a tap and target and transform spec (only/skip/etc.).\n\nWe'd have:\n\n- A named `job` has one or more `tasks`\n- A `schedule` points to a named `job` _or_ the `job` contains a `schedule` description\n- Optionally, we can choose to support parallel groups of tasks, such as invoking multiple taps together.\n  - Parallel groups might run serially if invoked locally via the CLI, but they'd generate a parallel structure when passed to an external orchestrator such as Airflow.\n\nThe assumption is that these would all run using `meltano run`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n- name: daily-eltp\n  tasks:\n  # EL pipelines can run in parallel:\n  - - tap-shopify target-snowflake\n    - tap-github target-snowflake\n  # These dbt build steps run in sequence:\n  - dbt:run --full-refresh\n  - dbt:test\n  # Last mile steps can run in parallel:\n  - - superset:build             # BI build\n    - tap-snowflake target-yaml  # reverse ETL can run in parallel with BI build\n- name: hourly-refresh\n  tasks:\n  - tap-slack target-snowflake\n  - dbt:run\n\n# schedules are separate and can reference jobs\nschedules:\n# ...\n```\n\n## Defining steps with rich metadata (out of scope for iteration 1)\n\nWe should plan for future support of rich task definitions (could have `name`, `type`, 'needs', etc.) instead of simple strings. \n\nThe shorthand of simple string representation is easy to understand, read, and maintain. However, this cannot handle advanced dag dependency representations. Supporting both smartly will likely be needed in future for advanced use cases:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n- name: daily-eltp\n  tasks:\n  # A complex task object could be inlined with string-based tasks\n  - type: invoke\n    command: dbt:run\n    config: ... # perhaps overrides here or perhaps some other future syntax options\n  - dbt:test\n  - - superset:build             # BI build\n    - tap-snowflake target-yaml  # reverse ETL can run in parallel with BI build\n```\n\nFor each item in the tasks array, if the type is `string`, pass along basically as a `meltano run` arg. If the type is object (dict in python), then parse as a complex task.\n\n## Jobs' relationship to schedules\n\nSchedules likely should be environment specific, but perhaps this should be held until a future iteration.\n\n```yaml\nschedules:\n- name: daily-eltp-schedule\n  job: daily-eltp\n  interval: daily\n  environments:\n  - prod\n- name: hourly-refresh-schedule\n  job: hourly-refresh\n  interval: hourly\n  environments:\n  - prod\n  - dev\n#...\n```\n\n\n## Referencing a job from `meltano run`\n\nWe would expand `meltano run` to accept job names as well as plugin names.\n\nSo assuming 2 jobs are defined, `dbt-daily-refresh` and `daily-el-sync`, these invocations could be valid:\n\n_Possibly out of scope for first iteration_\n\n### Example A: EL steps followed by a named job.\n\nRuns one EL task and then all the tasks in the 'dbt-daily-refresh' job.\n\n```bash\nmeltano run tap-slack target-snowflake dbt-daily-refresh\n```\n\n### Example B: A job followed by a list of commands.\n\nRuns all the EL tasks in the `daily-el-sync` job and then run dbt.\n\n```bash\nmeltano run daily-el-sync dbt:run dbt:test\n```\n\n### Example C: Two sequential jobs.\n\nRuns all the tasks in the `daily-el-sync` job and then all the tasks in the 'dbt-daily-refresh' job.\n\n```bash\nmeltano run daily-el-sync dbt:run dbt:test\n```\n\n## Regarding name collisions\n\nIn order for jobs to be referenced in `meltano run`, there cannot be collisions between plugin names and job names.\n\n## CLI Interface\n\n#### jobs\n\n`meltano job \u003cjob_name\u003e` add a job\n\n`meltano job \u003cjob_name\u003e add schedule \u003cinterval\u003e` Schedule the job\n\n`meltano job \u003cjob_name\u003e add schedule '[\u003cinterval\u003e, ...]' ` Add more schedules\n\n`meltano job \u003cjob_name\u003e tasks \u003crun commands\u003e` #

smoothly and I have meltano up and running inside the Ubuntu LXD container now.. but I shouldn't have to use venv IMO.. \n\n### Further regression test\n_Ensure we automatically catch similar issues

Deployment to AWS Lambda (Serverless)","description":"AWS Lambda provides a fully-managed (serverless) environment that includes both scheduling and compute (including docker). By supporting lambda as a deployment option and orchestrator for Meltano we can provide an easy onramp into the Meltano ecosystem for customers already on AWS but otherwise unwilling to host and manage a self-deployed orchestrator like Airflow.\n\nIntegration would include:\n\n- A lambda-compatible docker container for Meltano\n- A way to manage state utilising only serverless services (DynamoDB, Aurora Serverless, S3 etc.)\n- A way to gracefully handle the 15min max execution time of Lambda.\n\nThere are several possible approaches to the final requirement:\n\n- Include a new `--max-execution-time` flag that terminates the tap gracefully (emitting state) even when more upstream records are available. This allows meltano to sync data using successive Lambda invocations without being 'reset' to a previous state due to timeouts, but carries the risk that streams fall behind and never catch up with the upstream source.\n- Parallelise pipelines using 'one stream per function' to minimise the risk of several streams in a single pipeline approaching the limit.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-01T14:11:00.684Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T09:36:45.638Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T09:36:45.597Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Needs Refinement","flow::To Do","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2286180,"iid":206,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Q2-2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:22:10.509Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T17:51:23.679Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/206"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2911","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":40,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2911","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2911/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2911/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2911","relative":"#2911","full":"meltano/meltano#2911"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":124,"epic":{"id":348329,"iid":124,"title":"Deploying Meltano","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/124","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92846507,"iid":2908,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Support Deployment Plugins","description":"For Meltano to truly be a 'one-stop-shop' for your data platform, it needs to be able to deploy the individual tools and services that make up that platform. To achieve this Meltano should support deployment plugins, being existing tools for deploying and managing running infrastructure (such as Helm, Terraform, Ansible, Salt, Cloudformation). For those just getting started, Meltano should aim to provide opinionated base config for common scenarios (e.g. containers on Kubernetes), and for power users of these deployment tools the config and internals should still be accessible and easily customisable via existing Meltano config routes.\n\nAs a rough guide, the CLI could look something like:\n\n```bash\n# First a user would add a deployment. This would install all the necessary tooling to actually deploy to this platform during `meltano install`. Meltano will use all of the context of installed plugins, orchestrators and config to create appropriate deployment artefacts.\nmeltano add deployment --platform kubernetes --environment prod\n\n# Users can optionally configure their deployment\nmeltano config deployment --environment prod set namespace \"team-data\"\n\n# Finally a new deployment can be executed 🚀\nmeltano deploy --environment prod\n\n# Individual tools can also be invoked and used directly\nmeltano invoke helm list --all-namespaces --all\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-31T08:07:24.001Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T09:36:23.199Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T09:36:23.178Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Discussion","Needs Refinement","Office Hours::To Discuss","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351602,"iid":211,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Q3-2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:41.523Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:41.523Z","due_date":"2022-09-30","start_date":"2022-07-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/211"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2908","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":40,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2908","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2908/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2908/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2908","relative":"#2908","full":"meltano/meltano#2908"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":79,"epic":{"id":53029,"iid":79,"title":"Running pipelines in production","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/79","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":92696255,"iid":2907,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Refresh catalog on every invoke (fresh_catalog: true))","description":"I want to have Meltano build a new catalog every run when running `meltano invoke tap-oracle`\n\nA key at the SingerPlugin level probably makes sense, maybe call it `fresh_catalog` default to false? \n\nMore specific than #2850 as #2627 didn't solve what I'm after.

file bundle is added twice via `--include-related` if its configuration does not contain the `update` field","description":"### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen adding a plugin with `--include-related`, Meltano adds a related file bundle plugin twice if it does not include the `update` field in its schema. The file bundles installs correctly if `update` is given with any key-value pair.\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe file bundle should be added only once with `--include-related`, regardless of whether or not the `update` field is provided.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Define a custom file bundle plugin (e.g. `files-google-analytics`) sharing a namespace of some other plugin (e.g. `tap-google-analytics` with namespace `tap_google_analytics`) **WITHOUT** any `update` field\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  repo: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n1. Add the file bundle via `--include-related` (e.g. `meltano add extractor tap-google-analytics --include related`)\n1. Observe file bundle (`files-google-analytics`) add twice, with two occurences of `Adding related file bundle 'files-google-analytics' to your Meltano project...` in the output log.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n*Installs correctly*\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  update:\n    path/to/some/file: true\n  repo: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  update:\n    path/to/some/file: false\n  repo: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n*Installs incorrectly*\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  repo: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  update: {}\n  repo: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https://github.com/me/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nIf `update` is not provided, Meltano [defaults it to an empty object (`{}`)](https://meltano.com/docs/plugins.html#update-extra), which I assume is the root cause of this bug. Specifying `update: {}` manually yields the same results.\n\n### Further regression test\n\n- [ ] Write additional adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-10T09:35:49.104Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T00:30:07.075Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T00:30:07.060Z","closed_by":{"id":1942272,"username":"tayloramurphy","name":"Taylor A Murphy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1942272/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tayloramurphy"},"labels":["flow::Triage","kind::Bug","urgency::default","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2199293,"iid":188,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Fri: Oct 1, 2021","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-23T17:51:43.030Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T19:58:37.631Z","due_date":"2021-10-01","start_date":"2021-09-25","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/188"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

Some of these environments may be dynamically keyed and fully \"disposable\", such as \"cicd-\u003cbuild_num\u003e\", and \"dev-\u003cperson_id\u003e\".\n\n## Today's Solutions\n\nToday there are two or three places where a user needs to specify their data platform information - for instance \"target-snowflake\" config, \"dbt profiles\", and the analyze config, and possibly a \"reverse-etl\" connector such as \"tap-snowflake\". There's not yet a meltano-native construct for reusing this config.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Environment config as a top-level construct\n\nWe propose adding a top-level `environments:` config element. This could be a combination of \"smart\" and \"passthrough\" settings, where \"smart\" settings are known and expected by meltano, and \"passthrough\" settings are anything that the target (or dbt profile) may require.\n\n### Environment Inheritance\n\nTo ease onboarding to support DRY principals - we should allow environments to inherit from each other. For instance, prod may be identical to dev except in the credentials and db name. Server name, and other connection-level parameters may be identical between these environments and we should allow the config to be reused - in the same way that the `inherits-from` construct supports this for plugins today.\n\n### Strawman Sample\n\nThis is only intended for conversation - the exact spec will evolve based on input:\n\n`meltano.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nproject_id: ...\nplugins: ...\nschedules: ...\nplugins:\n  extractors:\n  # this section unchanged - extractors referenced by name below in `sources`\n  - name: tap-github\n    namespace: tap_github\n    executable: tap-github\n    capabilities:\n    - state\n    - catalog\n    - discover\n    settings:\n    - name: searches\n      kind: array\n    - name: auth_token\n      kind: password\n    - name: start_date\n      value: '2010-01-01T00:00:00Z'\n  # ...\n\nenvironments:\n\n- name: prod\n  job_id_prefix: prod_             # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n\n  # The `destination` is the singular landing location (\"target\") for this environment\n  # Other environments inherit this destination and can customize either with `vars` or by overriding completely\n  default_loader: target-snowflake\n\n  enable_transforms: true  # or false if the target does not support transforms (e.g. target-jsonl or target-s3-csv)\n\n  # Here we list all the sources that `prod` should contain\n  # These reference names declared under `plugins-\u003eextractors`\n  # Other environments may inherit this list or override it\n  default_extractors:\n  - tap-github\n  - tap-zendesk\n  - tap-slack\n  - tap-github\n\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          db_name: \"${DB_NAME}\"                # References an environment-scoped env var\n          load_schema: \"${TAP_NAMESPACE}_raw\"  # Dynamic from the name of the currently-executing tap\n          account: \"${SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT}\"\n          user: \"${SNOWFLAKE_USER}\"\n          role: prod_loader_role\n          # ...\n\n  env:\n    # Env vars can be declared here when multiple plugins need to reference the same values\n    DB_NAME: \"Waffleshop_DB\"\n    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT: waffleshop.snowflakecomputing.net\n    SNOWFLAKE_USER: prod_loader\n\n- name: beta\n  job_id_prefix: beta_                       # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n  inherits_from: prod\n\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          role: beta_loader_role\n\n  env:\n    DB_NAME: \"Waffleshop_Beta\"\n    SNOWFLAKE_USER: beta_loader\n\n# The following environments are \"disposable\", meaning they are intentionally keyed for temporarily use\n\n- name: user_dev\n  job_id_prefix: dev_${USER}_                # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n  inherits_from: beta\n\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          role: beta_loader_role\n          load_schema: \"${USER}dev_${TAP_NAMESPACE}_raw\"        # Dynamic based on the USER environment variable\n\n  env:\n    DB_NAME: \"Development\"\n    SNOWFLAKE_USER: \"${USER}\"\n\n- name: cicd\n  job_id_prefix: cicd_b${GITHUB_BUILD_NUM}_  # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n  inherits_from: beta\n  sources:\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      extractors:\n      # Overrides to make CICD run faster using a subset of data\n      - name: tap-github\n        config:\n          searches:\n          - {name: \"target-athena\", query: \"target-athena+fork:only\"}\n          \n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          role: cicd_loader_role\n          load_schema: \"raw_b${GITHUB_BUILD_NUM}_${TAP_NAMESPACE}\" # Dynamic based on build number from Github CI pipeline\n```\n\nIn the simplest interations, all of the environment's config would be available to invoked plugins via a name prefix such as `$MELTANO_ENV_{VAR_NAME}`, such as `$MELTANO_ENV_SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `$MELTANO_ENV_DB_NAME`. Importantly, since we expect to be toggling the environment back and forth at runtime, the generated environment variables would not have the name of the environment contained within the variable name. However, we probably could still expose the environment name itself in something like `$MELTANO_ENV_NAME`, in case a plugin has native configuration which can branch based on that name.\n\n### Possibility for native understanding of needs of different plugin types\n\nThe above is a simple \"passthrough\" approach where these keywords might not be natively understood by Meltano. However, we may choose to create subprofiles (now or in a future iteration) where meltano could send slightly different config to a transformer versus what it would send to a loader.\n\n## Best reason not to build\n\nNone I can think of. It is one level of additional config to setup, so we may want to ensure it is optional. Especially for EL-only pipelines where there are no further steps, we would not want a user to _necessarily_ need to configure an environment if they are happy with simple tap-\u003etarget configuration as they perform today.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-24T17:25:42.516Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T18:28:31.278Z","closed_at":"2021-10-27T20:07:15.305Z","closed_by":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

Instead, \"plugins\" `have` \"commands\" and \"commands\" `can be of type` \"test\". A command is of type `test` if its name starts with the word `test`.\n\n## Older Proposal (2021-10-27):\n\n* Discussion of the proposed spec from this comment thread: https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2838#note_682557413\n\n1.

Already today: Each test command is invocable directly and can perform its actions based on just environment vars and other context such as command line args.\n1. New: **Any plugin with a `test` command can also have a `tests:` list entry in the top-level plugin config.** Each item in the list of `tests` can have the following properties:\n    1. `name` - optional, if test is to be referenced by name\n    2. `executable` - optional, overrides the executable of the default `test` command at the plugin level\n    3. `args` - optional, overrides the args of the `test` command at the plugin level\n    4. `env` (or `vars`) - a list of env variable name/value combinations to be passed to the executor\n1. New: Tests could be invoked with any of the following syntaxes:\n    1. `meltano run \u003cplugin\u003e:test` - runs any and all tests defined in the plugin declaration.\n        - If the `test` command exists but no `tests:` declaration, only the one test command will be executed.\n        - If the `tests:` entry also exists, all enumerated tests will be run in order.\n        - If the `test` command does not exist, the command fails.\n    2. `meltano test --all` (a new cli command) runs all defined tests in all plugins.\n    3. `meltano test \u003cplugin\u003e` runs all defined tests for the named plugin.\n    3. `meltano test \u003cplugin1\u003e \u003cplugin2\u003e` runs all defined tests for the named plugins.\n    4. `meltano test \u003cplugin\u003e:\u003ctest-name\u003e` runs a named test for the named plugin.\n    4. `meltano test \u003cplugin1\u003e:\u003ctest-name1\u003e \u003cplugin2\u003e:\u003ctest-name2\u003e` runs multiple named tests for the named plugins.\n\nFuture Considerations:\n\nSequencing would need to be provided explicitly in the `v1` release, but `depends_on` behavior could be added in a v2, perhaps after `environments` (#2869) is released.\n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003ePrevious proposals, click to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n## Option A: Dedicated CLI command `meltano validate` (confirmed first iteration)\n\nThis would run validations as a dedicated top-level command.

Create a hash of `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` and use a combination/hash of those hashes as the docker tag.\n    2. Before running the docker build, check if the docker hash already exists as a tag. If so, reuse the existing image in subsequent steps (skips the build time).\n    3. Create a manual build step which can be used to force docker image build a build even when nothing has changed.\n2. Running 'fail-early' tests redundantly without a fully-rebuilt docker image.\n    1. Start with a stock python image and/or the image from the last stable master build.\n    2. Run `poetry install` - which should finish immediately if there's nothing to do.\n    3. Run at minimum `pytest [3.8]` and `python_lint [3.8]` using the older image.

The default behavior when `kind` is not know would be to treat the value as insensitive. We may instead want to prompt the user to specify the `kind` and/or the sensitivity level of an otherwise undeclared setting value.\n\nFor instance, prompting a user to specify it if configuring with `meltano config \u003cplugin\u003e set \u003csetting\u003e \u003cvalue\u003e. Especially for custom taps (including many taps discovered from the hub), the `kind` and therefor the sensitivity level is not known, and we should probably not automatically default to that value _not_ being a secret. \n\nThis could also serve as a catch for typos or accidentally-incorrect setting names: rather than going through the wizard's steps and storing under the provided setting name, the user may realize they've input an incorrect setting name and abort, then retry the process with the correct setting name.\n\nHere's an example invocation. The result of the below (using an unknown/incorrect setting name) is that the setting gets stored in yaml as clear text:\n\n```\n% poetry run meltano config target-jsonl set myset thisisnotasecret\nLoader 'target-jsonl' setting 'myset' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'thisisnotasecret'\n```\n\n\n## Proposal\n\n- We should at minimum warn the user that `kind` is missing.\n- If an interactive prompt is available, we can ask the user interactively what the proper `kind` value is _before_ serializing the new setting value.\n  - The setting's `kind` entry would be serialized to yaml as well.\n- We can add a `--quiet` flag optionally, to mute the new behavior and treat the setting as `kind: string` if not set. (Same as current status quo.)\n\n## Proposal (Updated 2022-04-16)\n\n- Combining with #3227+:\n  - If `--interactive` is used, we can _also_ prompt for setting config (including `kind`) at the same time as prompting for the new value.\n  - If `--interactive` is not set, we can fail with a prompt to use `--interactive` _or_ we can automatically switch to `--interactive` mode if `kind` is missing or the setting is not yet defined.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-26T19:22:54.447Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T09:18:42.455Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T09:18:42.437Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Accepting Merge Requests","Configuration","Security","flow::Triage","kind::Tech Debt","urgency::high","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2286180,"iid":206,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Q2-2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:22:10.509Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T17:51:23.679Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/206"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2768","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2768","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2768/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2768/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2768","relative":"#2768","full":"meltano/meltano#2768"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":123,"epic":{"id":338495,"iid":123,"title":"Improve CLI User Experience","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/123","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":87268193,"iid":2758,"project_id":7603319,"title":"`meltano invoke airflow` fails with `StrictVersion` error when Airflow is misconfigured","description":"When LocalExecutor set w/ default SQLite meltano gives StrictVersion object has no attribute 'version' error. \nThe actual message should be something like that: \"error: cannot use SQLite with the LocalExecutor.\"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-18T09:10:49.995Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T19:27:55.548Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T19:27:55.370Z","closed_by":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"labels":["CLI","flow::Review","kind::Bug","urgency::higher","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2112410,"iid":171,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Fri: July 16, 2021","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-21T15:32:22.818Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T21:55:01.140Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-07-10","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/171"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

We could add a command like `meltano job rename \u003cold_job_id\u003e \u003cnew_job_id\u003e`. `meltano job` could also later include `list`, which might be helpful for building a `tap-meltano` in the future if you want to use Meltano to track pipelines.  Alternate vocabulary could be `runs` instead of `jobs` as it seems like the codebase and docs are preferring that term.\n\nAnother way to do it would be to make a `meltano state` command to manage state. It could have `meltano state get \u003cjob_id\u003e`, `meltano state set \u003cjob_id\u003e \u003cstate\u003e`, `meltano state reset \u003cjob_id\u003e` (see #2568+). Then renaming could be something like `meltano state get \u003cold_job_id\u003e | meltano state set \u003cnew_job_id\u003e`. Pipe syntax would be handy if you wanted to use a tool like `jq` to mutate states in complex ways.\n\nBoth of these options use a noun command as a verb command doesn't seem to make sense here. Currently Meltano seems to use a mix of verbs (`discover`, `init`, `install`, `upgrade`) and nouns (`user`, `schema`, `config`).\n\n### Proposal Update (2022-01-31)\n\n_(Appended by AJ.)_\n\nTo manage state migration, we'd add `get`, `set`, `clear`, and `copy` options a new `meltano state` command.\n\n1. `list`\n   - `meltano state list` (output list of available Job IDs to STDOUT)\n1. `set`\n   - `meltano state set \u003cJOB-ID\u003e \u003cstate-json-text\u003e` (input from text string or STDIN)\n   - `meltano state set \u003cJOB-ID\u003e --input-file=\u003cjson-state-file\u003e` (input from file)\n   - `cat state.json | meltano state set \u003cJOB-ID\u003e` (input from text string or STDIN)\n1. `show` (or `get`)\n   - `meltano state show \u003cJOB-ID\u003e` (output to STDOUT)\n   - `meltano state show \u003cJOB-ID\u003e \u003e \u003cjson-state-file\u003e` (output to file)\n1. `clear` (or `reset`)\n   - `meltano state clear \u003cJOB-ID\u003e` (or `meltano state reset`)\n1. `copy`\n   - `meltano state copy \u003cJOB-ID-1\u003e \u003cJOB-ID-2\u003e`\n1. `move`\n   - `meltano state move \u003cJOB-ID-1\u003e \u003cJOB-ID-2\u003e` (or `meltano state rename`)\n1. `merge`\n   - `meltano state merge \u003cFROM-JOB-ID\u003e \u003cTO-JOB-ID\u003e` (update job 2 state, replacing and merging status from job 1)\n\n### First iteration\n\nAs a first iteration, I think we'd just need items `#1-3`, which are `list`, `set`, and `show` - and optionally the fourth subcommand `clear`. With those three or four subcommands, users could accomplish the other functions in a multi-step processes. For instance, instead of `copy`, the user could run something like `meltano state show \u003cOLD-ID\u003e | meltano state set` and accomplish the same effect. Similarly, a `rename` operation could have the same workaround as `copy` except also running a manual `clear` after the copy.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-14T18:02:00.150Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T16:23:14.289Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T23:24:48.993Z","closed_by":{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4025463/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cjohnhanson"},"labels":["Accepting Merge Requests","CLI","Extract","OKR: Be the DataOps OS","Office Hours::Discussed","Roadmap","flow::Review","kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351598,"iid":208,"group_id":2524164,"title":"April 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:06.797Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T14:53:27.097Z","due_date":"2022-04-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/208"},"assignees":[{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4025463/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cjohnhanson"}],"author":{"id":689351,"username":"rabidaudio","name":"Charles Julian Knight","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e3f99640d60577f72086b54087423593?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rabidaudio"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4025463/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cjohnhanson"},"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2754","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":12,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2754","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2754/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/2754/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2754","relative":"#2754","full":"meltano/meltano#2754"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":135,"epic":{"id":415886,"iid":135,"title":"meltano run improvements for meltano elt parity","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/135","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":86813182,"iid":2751,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Entity selection does not work when stream names have periods in them","description":"### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nI’ve installed a custom plugin for redshift as an extractor (`pip install tap-redshift`). I had to do some debugging of their code but I got it working all except for the entity selection. When I do a `meltano select tap-redshift --list --all`, I get a list of all the tables in the `schema` set in my config. However, when I try to add model selection to the `meltano.yml` file using the expected syntax (i.e., `database.schema.table.*`), I can’t get any of the entities in that list highlighted in green (‘selected’) no matter what I do. It almost feels like the select cli command doesn’t play nice with custom plugins.\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nIf I enter\n```\nselect:\n- database.schema.table.*\n```\nI would expect all columns in the listed table to be selected in green ('selected') after running a `meltano select --list --all` commmand.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nHere's my `meltano.yml`\n```\nversion: 1\nplugins:\n  extractors:\n  - name: tap-redshift\n    namespace: tap_redshift\n    pip_url: tap-redshift\n    executable: tap-redshift\n    capabilities:\n    - config\n    - discover\n    - catalog\n    - properties\n    config:\n      host: ############\n      port: 5439\n      dbname: matillion\n      schema: referencedata\n      start_date: 1900-01-01T01:01:01Z\n      user: ########\n      password: #########\n    select:\n    - 'matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.*'\n    metadata:\n      '*':\n        replication-method: FULL_TABLE\n\n```\n\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n```\n% meltano select tap-redshift --list --all                                   \nLegend:\n        selected\n        excluded\n        automatic\n\nEnabled patterns:\n        matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.*\n\nSelected attributes:\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.code_set_code\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.code_set_id\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.code_set_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.date_modified\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.modified_by\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.owner_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.steward_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.date_modified\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.lower_bound\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.metric_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.score_range_id\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.score_value\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.upper_bound\n```\n\nOn a separate note, the workaround I found was to use quotes and ignore the first couple of dots in the entity name.

when plugin `pip_url` changed and installation is outdated (pip_url drift)","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nI installed Meltano with tap-mysql and target-postgres. After creating some pipelines I realised that for a data set I needed to track deletions and this would require the transferwise variant. I switched the variant in the meltano.yml, but then spent a whilst trying to work out why it was not creating _sdc_deleted_at columns in postgres.\n\nThis is partially as I'm new, however the solution was to reinstall target-postgres with the transferwise variant. Everything then just worked, as you'd expect!\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nIt would really help (newer) users if the configuration validated the variant installed when it tried to run them.\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIf the installed variant of a tap or a target does not match the variant in the meltano.yml then an error or warning should be shown.\n\n### Proposed spec (added 2022-03-03)\n\n1.
