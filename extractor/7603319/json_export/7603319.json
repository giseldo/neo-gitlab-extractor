The resulting dirnames are pretty unwieldy though, and this would make it much harder to find a given plugin's installation directory just by browsing the filesystem and looking for its name. Adding a command to print the path (https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2337) would help, but there's a cost.\n\nAlternatively, we could have plugins fall back on their parent's installation dir if their `pip_url`s match, so that we'd only have `.meltano\/extractors\/tap-gitlab` until `tap-gitlab--inherited` changes its `pip_url` and gets a `.meltano\/extractors\/tap-gitlab--inherited`. Note that the directory names should always correspond to plugins _in the project_, so that names are known to be unique and map 1:1 to `pip_url`s. Plugins inheriting directly from a discoverable plugin (e.g. `tap-postgres--db-one` and `tap-postgres--db-two` both inheriting from `tap-postgres`, without a plugin by that name existing in the project) would not use their parent plugin's name for the installation directory, since the name could refer to multiple variants with their own `pip_url`s.\n\nThis approach is consistent with the current behavior, where plugin dir names match project plugin names, with the addition of inheritance (unless `pip_url` is overridden). I think the limitation that it doesn't apply to plugins that don't share a common ancestor in the project, but do share a `pip_url`, is acceptable.\n\n<\/details>\n\n## Updated Summary (2022-03-03)\n\nThere are a few paths forward on this which each have their own pros\/cons.\n\nThere are also a couple related issues that make the matter overall more complex:\n\n- #3068+\n- #2701+ \n\n## Simplest solution, using `inherits_from`\n\nThe simplest solution is to use the `inherits_from` option as a trigger for leveraging the same installation `venv_path` internally within Meltano. \n\nThis rule would apply _only_ if the plugin inheriting from does not also define `pip_url`. If `pip_url` is also defined _and is different_, the `venv_path` for that plugin would be based only on its own name rather than its parent (meaing, a unique venv).\n\nPseudocode:\n\n```py\n    @property\n    def venv_name(self) -> string:\n        \"\"\"Get the venv name this plugin should use.\"\"\"\n        if not self.inherits_from:\n            # No parent. Use a unique venv per plugin.\n            return self.plugin_name\n\n        if not self.pip_url or self.inherits_from.pip_url == self.pip_url:\n            # Use the parent's venv. Plugin is inheriting and there's no difference in pip_url.\n            return self.parent.name\n\n        # Default to unique venv per plugin.\n        return self.plugin_name\n```\n\nPros:\n\n- It works automatically with users' existing project definitions.\n- It speeds up the installation for most projects if they use `inherits_from` at least once in their project.\n\nCons:\n\n- This would not solve for #3068 or #2701.\n  - It doesn't solve for detecting changes in `pip_url`. (#2701)\n  - It may or may not be able to solve for inheritance between plugins of different types, for instance: the scenario described in #3068 where it is desirable for `dbt` and `sqlfluff` to share a venv.\n    - This is tricky because `inherits_from` was never imagined to solve for inheritance across a `transformer` plugin, for instance, and a `utility` plugin.\n    - In theory, this too could be made to work, but even so, the other implications of `inherits_from` seem broader than would applicable to diverse utilities of fundamentally different functions and configuration options.\n- It doesn't solve for reconciling plugin names with their venvs if a plugin is renamed within `meltano.yml`.\n- It doesn't solve for `pip_url` which just _happen_ to be identical. (Not a common use case anyway.)\n\n\n## Possible resolution strategy\n\nIn sequence, this might get us where we want to go:\n\n1. Solve for the simplest `inherits_from` cases, as described above. This would probably solve for 90% of the venv duplication issues for an average project.\n2. To solve for the \"pip_url drift\" issue described in #2701, leave a marker file within the venv page during installation with the text of `pip_url` text. Then check the pip_url against the marker file on each execution. If it differs from the current value of `pip_url`, raise a warning or error that prompts the user to reinstall.\n3. To resolve complex venv sharing use cases described in #3068, expand the spec so that plugins can \"inherit\" or \"share\" _only_ the venv of another plugin, without having to inherit all the other types of functionality, such as config, commands, etc. (More details on alternatives are in #3608, and presumably those solutions would stack with the `inherits_from` and 'pip_url drift detection' in the above two issues.)","state":"closed","created_at":1609370634256,"updated_at":1651599051931,"closed_at":1651599051905,"closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken

This could be as simple as a \"meltano add validator\" type wrapper and integration into the elt runs, or some other form of integration\n\nIt would also be neat for Great Expectations to show up in the Meltano UI, maybe with Data Docs\/validation results integrated into the UI, potentially even with a \"configure\" interface to the great_expectations.yml config file (although that is definitely a stretch).\n\nOne example for a UI integration of GE validation results is Dagster: https:\/\/dagster.io\/blog\/great-expectations-for-dagster\n\n### Target audience\nThe target audience would be two-fold: \n1. Data engineers\/owners of the Meltano workflow who run the pipelines and want to see whether all source data was correctly extracted and whether data was correctly transformed, and \n2. data consumers (stakeholders) that want to use Data Docs for data documentation and to see the most recent validation status.\n\n### Further details\nNot much to add - data validation is crucial to pipelines, and I think making it more accessible\/part of Meltano would be really beneficial for users!\n\n### Proposal (older)\n\n<details><summary>Click to expand<\/summary>\n\nI would love to hear from existing GE users how they envision this could work - here are some of my thoughts:\n- At a very high level, maybe we could add another key concept like a \"validator\" that can be added to a Meltano project. This could potentially even be a wrapper for \"great_expectations init\" to initialize a GE data context in the Meltano project. \n- A user would then either configure a GE datasource manually, or all data connections could be inherited from Meltano. \n- The user would then create Expectation Suites and Checkpoints. Running \"meltano elt\" (possibly with a --run-validation flag?) could then trigger running all configured Checkpoints as part of a pipeline. I'm not quite clear yet how or whether a user would specify when exactly to run validation.\n\n<\/details>\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nAcceptance criteria: a user can run validation with GE as part of a Meltano pipeline run without having to invoke GE separately, and can see the results either in Data Docs or directly in the Meltano UI.\n\nSuccess: people actually run validation with GE in Meltano!\n\n\n### Links \/ references\n\n* GE homepage: greatexpectations.io\n* Dagster integration: https:\/\/dagster.io\/blog\/great-expectations-for-dagster\n* Airflow operator (as an example of how to invoke validation): https:\/\/github.com\/great-expectations\/airflow-provider-great-expectations\n\n### Updated Proposal (2022-01-05)\n\n1. Using the recently released Meltano features `dbt test` and `test commands`, Meltano users should be able to add Great Expectations as a utility plugin.\n    1. First phase: Great Expectations can be added manually to `meltano.yml` by users familiar with Great Expectations (or in Meltano-owned projects like the Hub).\n    2. Second phase: Assuming positive results from \"first phase\" above, Great Expectations will be added to `discovery.yml` so that users can add it using the command `meltano add utility great-expectations` (with no `--custom` flag).\n2. Within `meltano.yml`, users will add `commands` with names starting with a `test*` prefix.\n3. Tests will be runnable using any of these:\n    - `meltano test --all`\n    - `meltano test great-expectations`\n    - `meltano test great-expectations:test-foo great-expectations:test-bar`\n    - `meltano run great-expectations:test-foo great-expectations:test-bar` (because tests are also commands)\n\n### Special commands and functions\n\nDocs\/UI:\n\nWe may also need to come up with a `great-expectations:ui` command which would build and launch\n\nInit:\n\nWe may also want a predefined `init` command and perhaps commands for other administrative operations.","state":"closed","created_at":1605554243490,"updated_at":1645121692814,"closed_at":1645018864589,"closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken

In `meltano select --list --all`, nested properties without discovered(!) `inclusion` metadata shouldn't be listed at all, since they can't actually be individually selected.

transformations to be defined in `meltano.yml` (Stream Maps)","description":"<details><summary>Expand Original Issue Description<\/summary>\n\nInspired by https:\/\/www.dropbase.io\/, PipelineWise transformations (https:\/\/transferwise.github.io\/pipelinewise\/user_guide\/transformations.html), and our [existing extractor extras](https:\/\/meltano.com\/docs\/plugins.html#metadata-extra), I'm imagining something like:\n\n```yaml\nextractors:\n- name: tap-example\n  # ...\n  transform:\n    <entity>:\n      <function>: <args>\n      <attribute>:\n        <function>: <args>\n```\n\nSince these transformations would act on an extractor's output: a stream of Singer `SCHEMA` and `RECORD` messages, we could relatively easily support functions for:\n- renaming (prefixing, suffixing) entity (stream, table) or attribute (property, column) names\n- dropping entities or attributes, in cases where a tap doesn't support discovery mode and entity selection\n- adding attributes with predefined or dynamic values, like PipelineWise's metadata columns: https:\/\/transferwise.github.io\/pipelinewise\/user_guide\/metadata_columns.html\n- filtering records based on one or more attribute values, keeping only those that do (or don't!) match (`drop_if`, `drop_unless`?)\n- replacing text in attribute values\n- replacing empty strings with nulls\n- replacing nulls with a string\n- changing attribute types and casting values, which can go beyond overriding the JSON schema using the [`schema` extra](https:\/\/meltano.com\/docs\/plugins.html#schema-extra)\n\nFunctions could take arguments of any type: a simple string, an array of values, or an object with additional keys. If a function doesn't take any attribute (like `drop`), it could just take a `true` boolean.\n\nSince functions could have object arguments, Meltano would not immediately be able to distinguish between `{entity: {attribute: {function: scalar_value}}}` and `{entity: {function: {nested_key: nested_value}}}`, where the key nested under an entity identifier could either be an attribute identifier or a function name. We don't have this issue with [`metadata`](https:\/\/meltano.com\/docs\/plugins.html#metadata-extra) and [`schema`](https:\/\/meltano.com\/docs\/plugins.html#schema-extra) extras, because metadata values cannot (so far) be objects, and since schema info can only be specified for attributes, not entities as a whole. Perhaps we can add a special `_` or `_self` or `_entity` key at the attribute level to nest entity-level transformation functions under, in cases where they need object values.\n\n<\/details>\n\n## Background (Updated 2021-12-15)\n\nThere would be a large advantage to being able to enable transformations like those from [pipelinewise-transform-field](https:\/\/github.com\/transferwise\/pipelinewise-transform-field) and Meltano SDK's [Inline Stream Maps](https:\/\/sdk.meltano.com\/en\/latest\/stream_maps.html) to be defined natively in `meltano.yml` config.\n\nThis opens up a large number of use cases defined on the SDK docs site:\n\n> ### Stream-Level Mapping Applications\n>\n> - Stream aliasing: streams can be aliased to provide custom naming downstream.\n> - Stream filtering: streams records can be filtered based on any user-defined logic.\n> - Stream duplication: streams can be split or duplicated and then sent as multiple distinct streams to the downstream target.\n> \n> ### Property-Level Mapping Applications\n>\n> - Property-level aliasing: properties can be renamed in the resulting stream.\n> - Property-level transformations: properties can be transformed inline.\n> - Property-level exclusions: properties can be removed from the resulting stream.\n> - Property-level additions: new properties can be created based on inline user-defined expressions.\n\nAs well as fixes for these common issues:\n\n- Applying selection rules to taps that don't support selection.\n- Resolve issues caused by taps that use selection rules to filter `RECORD` messages but not the `SCHEMA` messages that is used to create target tables.\n- Resolve compatibility issues from taps that send data types that the chosen target cannot understand.\n- Resolve compatibility issues from taps that send `ACTIVATE_VERSION` messages to targets that don't understand them.\n- Need for \"record flattening\" when neither the tap or target supports this feature natively.\n\n## Proposal: Map transforms as properties of extractors and loaders (Updated 2021-12-15)\n\nAfter running the following...\n\n```bash\nmeltano add mapper meltano-map-transform\nmeltano add mapper pipelinewise-transform-field\n```\n\n... you would be able to provide a config such as:\n\n\n```yaml\nmappers:\n- name: meltano-map-transform\n  pip_url: meltano-map-transform\n  config:                         # Optionally, a default config.\n    # ...\n- name: pipelinewise-transform-field\n  pip_url: pipelinewise-transform-field\n- name: no-activate-version.      # A fictional mapper that removes ACTIVATE_VERSION messages\n  pip_url: no-activate-version\n  config:                         # Optionally, a default config.\n    # ...\nextractors:\n- name: tap-gitlab\n  # ...\n  mappings:\n  - name: pii-hasher               # The name of the map transform to apply.\n    mapper: meltano-map-transform  # The mapper plugin to use.\n    config:                        # What will be sent to the transformer in a config.json file.\n      stream_maps:\n        customers:\n          id_hashed: md5(record['id'])\n          id: None\nloaders:\n- name: target-salesforce\n  # ...\n  mappings:\n  - name: add-global-guid          # The name of the map transform to apply.\n    mapper: meltano-map-transform  # The mapper plugin to use.\n    config:                        # What will be sent to the transformer in a config.json file.\n      stream_maps:\n        customers:\n          guid: md5(record['id'])\n- name: target-csv\n  # ...\n  mappings:\n  - name: flatten-records          # The name of the map transform to apply.\n    mapper: meltano-map-transform  # The mapper plugin to use.\n    default: true                  # Transform prepended automatically if default=true.\n    config:                        # What will be sent to the transformer in a config.json file.\n      flatten_records: true\n  - name: compat-fix               # The name of the map transform to apply.\n    mapper: no-activate-version    # The mapper plugin to use.\n                                   # config is omitted if the generic config is sufficient\n```\n\nOne or more map transforms may be placed between tap and target:\n\n```bash\nmeltano run tap-gitlab pii-hasher target-salesfoce\nmeltano run tap-gitlab pii-hasher flatten-records target-csv\n```\n\nSince `default=true` for `flatten-records` and `compat-fix` on `target-csv`, these are all equivalent:\n\n```bash\nmeltano run tap-gitlab flatten-records target-csv\nmeltano run tap-gitlab target-csv\n```\n\nNote: For the example config above, this command would fail because `flatten-records` is only defined for `target-csv` and is not defined for `tap-gitlab` nor `target-salesforce`: `meltano run tap-gitlab flatten-records target-salesforce`.","state":"closed","created_at":1598034763092,"updated_at":1646174583636,"closed_at":1645221737099,"closed_by":{"id":22132,"username":"pandemicsyn","name":"Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88529f59d3f298bcc9e2a705dc1f1c68?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/pandemicsyn"},"labels":["Extract","Office

plugin commands","description":"The `tap-mssql` plugin is a good example of a non-standard, non-python tap which would nevertheless be desirable for mainstream support. One way to support this is by adding a docker_image option in discovery.yml and work through whatever issues come up in that process.\n\nOriginally started as a discussion here: https:\/\/meltano.slack.com\/archives\/C013Z450LCD\/p1596043957041600?thread_ts=1595992122.035100&cid=C013Z450LCD\n\n--------------\n\n## Update (2021-08-24)\n\n-----------------\n\nThe original use case for this issue (java-based `singer\/tap-mssql`) is no longer a priority since we now have a python-based `tap-mssql` implementation and there just haven't been many (any?) other taps or targets requested which were not pip installable.\n\nA newer use case is Lightdash, which has a complex set of requirements and is recommended to be run via docker - or specifically via docker compose.\n\n## Update ~~(2021-10-05)~~ ~~(2021-11-29)~~ (2021-12-07)\n\nIn discussions around this topic, it appears clear we need to provide docker and non-docker invocation methods for plugins so that a `--container=True` flag (or similar) could toggle the behavior to dockerized vs native invocation methods. The docker config is then additive to existing `executable` and `pip_url` inputs.\n\n### New `container_spec` option for plugin commands\n\nThis feature would add a structured `container_spec` config option to each plugin command:\n\n```yml\nplugins:\n    utilities:\n        name: lightdash\n        commands:\n        - name: serve\n          executable: \"lightdash serve\"  # ignored when running via docker\n          container_spec:\n            image: lightdash\n            command: lightdash serve\n            entrypoint: \n            env:\n                ENVVAR1: foo\n                ENVVAR2: bar\n            ports:\n            - 5000\n            - 8080\n            volumes:\n            - \".:\/project\/myproject\"\n        - name: build\n          executable: \"lightdash build\"  # ignored when running via docker\n          container_spec:\n            image: lightdash\n            command: lightdash build\n            entrypoint: \n            env:\n                ENVVAR1: foo\n                ENVVAR2: bar\n            ports: [] # None needed\n            volumes:\n            - \".:\/project\/myproject\"\n```\n\n### Supported `container_spec` options in V1:\n\n* `image`\n* `vars`\n* `ports`\n* `command`\n* `entrypoint`\n* `volumes` - or *at least* a container path in which to mount the root project dir\n\nOnly `image` is required. All other options are optional.\n\n### New `--containers=true|false` flag for CLI commands `elt`, `invoke`, and `run`\n\nThe CLI commands `elt`, `invoke`, and `run` would all have a new `--containers` CLI arg. This arg has the following behaviors:\n\n- `true`: This uses `container_spec` whenever it is available.\n    - Important: `true` setting does not guarantee that all invocations will be run containerized. Any plugin or command that does not have a `container_spec` will be attempted to be invoked natively. If native invocation fails, the command will fail - as is the existing behavior today.\n- `false`: This users local invocation (non-containerized) for all plugins. (Assumption being that there is no container runtime available on the machine.)\n    - Note: If a plugin _only_ has a `container_spec` config and does not have any other means of being invoked, then the command will fail.\n\nNote that if multiple plugins need to be invoked, they will share the same preference setting across the entire meltano CLI command.\n\n#### Sample invocation\n\nFor instance, taking the following sample invocation: `meltano --containers=true run tap-gitlab target-snowflake dbt:run dbt:test lightdash:build` and assuming that only `tap-gitlab` and `lightdash:build` have a defined `container_spec`, the behavior will be as follows:\n\n- `tap-gitlab` will be invoked within a container and its data will be passed to the STDIN of `target-snowflake`, which will be running natively.\n- `dbt:run` and `dbt:test` will both be run natively, since no `container_spec` exists for those commands.\n- `lightdash:build` will be run within a container.\n\nAssuming the same command is run with `--containers=false`, and assuming `lightdash:build` does not also have an non-containerized `executable` set, then meltano will fail to build an execution plan and will abort immediately with something like:\n\n> Execution of `lightdash:build` is not defined when container runtimes are disabled. To proceed, add a native `executable` definition to `lightdash:build` command or run with `--containers=true` to enable containerized execution.\n\nLastly, if `executable` and `container_spec` are both provided for the `lightdash:build` command, but the command is invoked natively (`--containers=false`) without the proper prerequisites installed, then the command will fail at the very end of the job when `meltano run` reaches the final `lightdash:build` step.\n\n#### Optional CLI conventions we could support:\n\n- `--containers` is short for `--containers=true`\n- `--no-containers` is short for `--containers=false`\n\n\n## Out of scope\n\n### Tap and Target containerization\n\nWe will probably build support for general plugins (`transformers`, `orchestrators`, and `utilities`) first - or more specifically for plugin `commands` first.\n\nDue to the additional complexity, containerized extractors and loaders would likely be a fast-follow on top of the first MVC release.\n\nUnlike for general utilities, the `container_spec` config for extractors and loaders needs to be at the plugin level, not the command level, and any `command` value will likely be ignored by Meltano at runtime, in favor of the ways that Meltano already knows to invoke a tap, especially: `tap-mytap --discover --config=\/path\/to\/config.json` (discovery) and `tap-mytap --config=\/path\/to\/config.json` (sync).\n\n### Compose Syntax and docker-compose.yml files\n\nOut of scope for now, but we _might_ also support docker-compose in future:\n\n```yml\nplugins:\n    utilities:\n        name: lighdash\n        commands:\n        - name: serve\n          container_spec:\n            compose: lightdash.docker-compose.yml\n```","state":"closed","created_at":1596045352517,"updated_at":1645552914337,"closed_at":1645153687730,"closed_by":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

When communicating to team members, the experiment has to be **reproducible** in order for them to have more technical depth. When communicating with executive, the experiment has to be **communicated in a simple manner** in order to have investment from leadership. Not only do executives and team members are stake holders, but other people in the company might be too. Scaling knowledge of experiments is difficult within any company. \n\n### Target audience\n\nData Scientist\n\n*  Frustrated at a company process designed for software engineers\n*  Might able to communicate success, but unable to explain the failed experiments leading up to that success. Failed experiments consists of the core pieces of insight gained by the scientist. Stakeholders often wonder why the process take so long.\n* .Might be able to communicate successful experiments to a few stakeholders, but unable to do so with all those that might be interested. Uable to scale their communication.\n* Frustrated at the slow decision making when the number of stakeholders that needed to be communicated to are high\n* Frustrated at the review process designed for software engineers -> Git code management system like Bitbucket does not have the necessary features to support the review process needed for high quality feedback for peers -> want to have high quality feedback on experiments to produce high quality results\n\n **As an organization grows, how do we make sure that an insight uncovered by one person effectively transfers beyond the targeted recipient?**\n\n### Further details\n\nOne of the major problems is not only sharing reports and analytics but also ML experiments so that knowledge can be pervasive. There have been attempts like this such as [Airbnb Knowledge Repo](https:\/\/github.com\/airbnb\/knowledge-repo) but it's an underinvested area. It's still an unsolved problem within the data science community.\n\n### Proposal\nCombine it with MLflow Projects to have reproducible experiments.\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n(Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria.

Opportunity Assessment\n\n@valexieva please add link here once written: --> both links below\n\n### Problem(s) to solve\nOur current product adoption path assumes users launch Meltano in their local development environment (their computer), however due to the size of many data sets this can cause issues with memory, performance, etc. which can limit user adoption and recurring MAU\n\nHowever, users also may be using Meltano on data that we do not want to responsible for hosting (PII, GDPR, etc.) so we also need to think about guiding them to use a production environment that makes sense for their needs.\n\n### Proposed Solution (to Validate)\nOffer the user a way to use Meltano while hosting their data somewhere that can handle a big data set. \n\nWill explore pros\/cons of different options, including:\n* Self-hosting Meltano on the user's existing infrastructure\n* Self-hosting Meltano on a one-click install (e.g. Bitnami, Dreamhost, Amazon, etc.)\n* Meltano hosted sandbox\n\n\n### Tasks to Complete Planning\/Exploration Sprint\n* [x] Write an opportunity assessment for a hosted sandbox experience (template here:

`.meltano\/dbt\/profiles.yml` for dbt","description":"## Background\n\nCurrently Meltano creates a not-very robust `profiles.yml` file which attempts to be \"one size fits all\" but it only supports a few different config options and has several magic environment variables it expects. This is a barrier to new users onboarding and frequently we get \"not declared\" errors for those environment variables being missing from runtime context.\n\nPros of status quo:\n\n1. Gives an out-of-box dbt experience for three different generic database configs: postgres, redshift, and snowflake\n    - https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/files-dbt\/-\/blob\/master\/bundle\/transform\/profile\/profiles.yml\n2. Doesn't require a user to understand the `profiles.yml` format.\n\nCons of status quo:\n\n1. Most users will end up deleting the extra profiles or modifying the file to make it their own. (Which feels wrong, like you are breaking the connection to Meltano.)\n1. There's no support for other databases like Spark or Redshift.\n1. Manual changes could get overridden if the files bundle is reinstalled.\n1. Following from point 1, it's not clear at all if overriding\/modifying the built-in `profiles.yml` is supported - or if there are other consequences of doing so.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Similarly to how Meltano pre-creates and manages config.json files and catalog.json files for taps, Meltano could auto-generate a hidden `profiles.yml` file internally to the `.meltano` directory.\n1. Meltano can populate values from config in `meltano.yml`, rather than requiring special environment variables to be set by the user.\n1. Meltano can pick what kind of dbt adapter to use based on the environment's `primary_loader` config (not yet built).\n1. As users get more mature in their usage of dbt, they may _optionally_ provide a path to their own generated profiles.yml file. This could be an optional config option for the `dbt` transformer and\/or of the meltano environment itself.\n1. The user can optionally provide a profile name for dbt to use - as a config option for the `dbt` transformer.\n    - If not set, the dbt profile target can default to the environment name (`prod`, `userdev`, etc.).\n1. Since the hidden file would not be version controlled, it can be adapted without breaking existing code. For instance, we could add handling for a Spark profile and we wouldn't need users to reinstall `files-dbt` bundle.","state":"closed","created_at":1638830400303,"updated_at":1653904792072,"closed_at":1653904792040,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Transform","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351601,"iid":210,"group_id":2524164,"title":"June 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-06-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/210"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3104","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3104","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3104\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3104\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3104","relative":"#3104","full":"meltano\/meltano#3104"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":82.0,"epic":{"id":102873,"iid":82,"title":"Improved dbt integration","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/82","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":98540152,"iid":3101,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Document pyenv\/poetry use in contributor docs","description":"Our getting started guide for contributors isn't super cohesive in how the setup steps for contributing to meltano, the meltano api, or the meltano ui are described, and what the expected dev environment looks like.\n\n1.

A lot of folks will already have experience with things like pyenv\/virtualenv\/poetry but it might still be nice to touch on them and clarify their potential use for managing your dev environments.","state":"closed","created_at":1638810345966,"updated_at":1650578825553,"closed_at":1650578825499,"closed_by":{"id":22132,"username":"pandemicsyn","name":"Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88529f59d3f298bcc9e2a705dc1f1c68?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/pandemicsyn"},"labels":["Documentation","flow::To Do","kind::Bug","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351598,"iid":208,"group_id":2524164,"title":"April 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:06.797Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T14:53:27.097Z","due_date":"2022-04-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/208"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":22132,"username":"pandemicsyn","name":"Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88529f59d3f298bcc9e2a705dc1f1c68?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/pandemicsyn"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3101","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3101","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3101\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3101\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3101","relative":"#3101","full":"meltano\/meltano#3101"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":81.0,"epic":{"id":94267,"iid":81,"title":"Meltano Documentation improvements","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/81","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":98479511,"iid":3099,"project_id":7603319,"title":"meltano run ci\/cd pipeline project","description":"Something similar to the `meltano\/demo-project` running as part of our CI\/CD suite but using `meltano run` would be handy.

Users may wish to have control of the development environment for each plugin, including adding additional tools for tests, linting etc. (e.g. SQLFluff with dbt).\n\nThis may also be an opportunity to support Docker containers for development. `meltano shell` may just as easily implement an equivalent of `docker run -it fishtownanalytics\/dbt` as `source \/path\/to\/dbt\/venv\/bin\/activate`. This may reduce the impact of cross-platform tooling support and configuration differences.\n\n### Proposal\n\nExample workflow for adding a new data integration using Meltano, dbt and Airflow:\n\n```shell\n$ git checkout -b 2345_add_gitlab_to_hub_pipeline\n\n# find a tap that matches the source I want to integrate\n$ meltano discover extractors\n> tap-gitlab\n> ...\n\n# add and configure the tap\n$ meltano add extractor tap-gitlab\n$ meltano config tap-gitlab set projects \"meltano\/meltano meltano\/sdk\"\n$ meltano config tap-gitlab set start_date 2021-10-01T00:00:00Z\n\n# now lets create a schedule\n$ meltano schedule gitlab-to-postgres tap-gitlab target-postgres @daily\n\n# and run a sample extract in my development environment, so dbt has data\n$ meltano --environment=dev_kp elt tap-gitlab target-postgres --job_id=gitlab-to-postgres\n\n# with a new extractor added and data extracted,\n# lets update our dbt models for the new source...\n\n# activate a console within the 'dbt' virtual env created by Meltano Project,\n# using secrets\/env vars from my personal dev environment\n$ meltano shell dbt --environment=dev_kp\n\n# luckily a postgres-compatible dbt package exists for the tap I just added \ud83d\ude05\n$ nano packages.yml\n> packages:\n  - package: dbt-labs\/gitlab\n    version: 0.7.0\n\n$ dbt deps\n\n# run the new package using creds from my dev_kp environment\n$ dbt run --select gitlab \n\n# done (optimistically)\n$ exit\n> back in parent project context\n\n# finally, lets update my hub DAG in Meltano Project (doesn't exist yet - see [#2920](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2920))\n$ nano meltano.yml\n> ...\ndags:\n  meltano_hub:\n    interval: @daily\n    steps:\n      - name: gitlab\n        cmd: 'meltano elt tap-gitlab target-postgres --job_id=gitlab-to-postgres'\n        retries: 2\n      - name: google_analytics\n        cmd: 'meltano elt tap-google-analytics target-postgres --job_id=google-analytics-to-postgres'\n      - name: product_mart\n        cmd: 'meltano invoke dbt run --select models\/marts\/product'\n        depends_on:\n          - gitlab\n          - google_analytics\n...\n\n# wonder if the new DAG actually works?\n# start a terminal session in the Airflow context\n$ meltano shell airflow --environment=dev_kp\n# Note: this could launch a local instance of `airflow webserver`\n# for developer convenience \ud83e\udd14\n\n$ airflow dags list\n> meltano_hub\n\n$ airflow dags trigger meltano_hub\n> runs DAG locally using config specified in dev_kp environment\n\n# *goes and checks the Airflow UI on http:\/\/localhost:8080 and the test warehouse for data*\n\n# done\n$ exit\n\n# lets see what the team thinks\n$ git commit -am \"added gitlab integration\"\n$ git push\n$ glab mr create\n# off it goes to CI \u2709\ufe0f\n\n# profit \u2615\ufe0f\n```\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nUsers can work productively in a plugins context facilitated (and not obstructed) by Meltano Project. New users to a Project do not need to worry about the mechanics of installation and configuration; onboarding to an existing Project is as easy as `git clone` and `meltano shell <plugin name>` \ud83d\ude80\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links \/ references\n\n- [#2920](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2920) Meltano should output a DAG-like data structure with individual pipeline components\n- [&82](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/82) Improved dbt integration\n- [#2210](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2205) Add `docker_image` property to support non-Python\/pip plugins\n\n_Please note that this was taken from GitLab, to be changed accordingly_\n\n## Option: Alternative framing around `meltano environment activate ...`\n\nWe should consider also if this could be an environment-level invocation, such as `meltano environment activate`. Which would be a much more robust version of sourcing the `.env` variables, but able to step into a context where all invocations are already contextualized and able to be invoked directly.\n\nIf an environment-level action, we get around issues of having to step separately into dbt and sqlfluff context separately, because all of the context for both would be set at time of activating the environment.","state":"closed","created_at":1637068977314,"updated_at":1653904515915,"closed_at":1653904515897,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty

This was a bit of a red herring or more a side effect - with the command simply complaining that the state file couldn't be read. When in reality the state capability wasn't being advertised by the plugin and so no state file was even being produced. \n\nWhile investigating that we realized the `meltano elt --dump=state` wasn't actually hitting the system db directly. It indirectly makes a bare `_invoke()` call using [plugin_invoker.dump](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/plugin_invoker.py#L288), which behind the scenes triggers the [look_up_state_hook](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/plugin\/singer\/tap.py#L165) - which in turn tries to read the state from the db, and if successful then [writes out the state to the state file](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/plugin\/singer\/tap.py#L246). After `_invoke()` completes, dump just tries to the read state file.\n\n1. If we can deprecate\/phase out the use of a state file, we could just update have the dump pull the state straight from the system db and go ahead and simplify the code in the tap ditching the state file generation code. \n2. If we need to continue generating the state file - dump could still do that - but we'd definitely want to refactor dump and look_up_state_hook to share some code. \n\nWith either path, a single consolidated look_up_state method for both the tap and dump to use is probably the move.","state":"closed","created_at":1636485644213,"updated_at":1653904463922,"closed_at":1653904463883,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["kind::Tech Debt","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351601,"iid":210,"group_id":2524164,"title":"June 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-06-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/210"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":22132,"username":"pandemicsyn","name":"Florian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88529f59d3f298bcc9e2a705dc1f1c68?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/pandemicsyn"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3054","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3054","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3054\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3054\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3054","relative":"#3054","full":"meltano\/meltano#3054"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":142.0,"epic":{"id":502327,"iid":142,"title":"`meltano state` management improvements","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/142","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":96974985,"iid":3052,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Meltano should print a warning if any of these are missing from capabilities: (`state`, `discover`, (`catalog` XOR `properties`))","description":"There are enough instances of expensive debug operations at this point (most recently [today](https:\/\/meltano.slack.com\/archives\/CKHP6G5V4\/p1636419311194200?thread_ts=1636399782.175500&cid=CKHP6G5V4)), that I think we should be printing an explicit warning message whenever any of these capabilities are not found in `discovery.yml`:\n\n1.

That's a simpler problem because we don't have release notes and the version number is just an auto-generated `dev` bump using the CI build number.\n \nOpening this issue to figure out how we get to similar simplicity for normal deployments.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Continue frequent releases.\n2. Reduce cost to dev productivity.\n3. Make dual-channel releases (`edge`\/`main`) more viable, as proposed in https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meta\/-\/issues\/135\n\n## Statu Quo\n\nHere are the current manual deployments steps (excluding marketing\/slack\/tweets, etc.):\n\n1. Open a release branch. (Triggers an auto-commit with the version bump.)\n2. Open a tag from the release branch. (Triggers the PyPi publish.)\n3. Groom the changelog. (Can be performed before, after, or in parallel with the above - since the changelog itself is not shipped.)\n\n## Ideal State\n\n### Changelog automation\n\nI don't know as much about this space but I believe there are some available options.\n\n### One-Step version bump, validation, and publish\n\nRather than requiring the tag to be created explicitly in a separate step, we can modify the CI pipeline to _also_ run the publish step in the special CI job that runs when a new branch is created like `release\/*`.\n\nThe special CI pipeline for `release\/*` tags can be removed in favor of the branch pipeline, to eliminate the need for a second step, and avoid \"chaining\" of auto-commits and CI jobs. We could still create the tag as part of the CI pipeline, rather than as a manual step.\n\n### Proposed flow\n\nReleases:\n\n1. As release manager, I create a correctly-named release branch which triggers the release pipeline.\n2. I click \"Merge when pipeline succeeds\" immediately - meaning, a successful CI run (including publish steps) will close out the version bump.\n\nChange Log Grooming:\n\n1.

It might make more sense to use orchestrators (Dagster or Airflow) first.\n\n## How is this different?\n\nToday, if we want to support Dagster in the same way we support Airflow, we have three levers we can control:\n\n1. CLI-based 'command' definitions. This is basically just aliasing existing CLI commands from the tool. Not capable of deep integrations.\n2. Files-based plugins. This is the least robust: we download some pre-configured files into the repo.\n3. Python code-based approach. This is the only \"deep\" integration option we have today. This gives a lot of power to wrap the tool's capabilities, but it also requires expanding the code base of `Meltano` core repo.\n\nThis proposal would give an alternate path to the third option, enabling us to write an external plugin definition in python, and import it into the project without having it defined tightly as part of that

This would resolve all dependencies, including the `discovery.yml` ref and combination of all `include-path` files for multi-meltano files.\n\nIn future iterations this could be expanded to:\n\n3. Include `catalog.json` caches.\n4. Resolve all config representations of `environments` so that each environment has a fully resolved schema (_except_ secrets and the content of any externally-managed environment variables.)~~ - Not needed in initial release.\n5. Optionally, include rich information of the DAG structure for known\/declared pipelines or schedules.\n\nBased on this lock file artifact, external tools such as Terraform, Databand, etc. could build environments and\/or obtain rich project metadata needed for integration.\n\nThis may also provide improved stability projects for projects running in the wild, as discussed in this comment: https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/128#note_734475476\n\n<\/details>\n\n### Alternate implementation option (2022-02-10)\n\nHere's an alternative that just focuses on freezing the plugin definitions, ideally copying those verbatim from their source of truth on hub.meltano.com\n\n#### Stable Installations via `meltano add`\n\nWe alter how `meltano add` installs new plugins:\n\n1. Instead of installing directly from `discovery.yml` and relying on the `discovery.yml` definition for resolution, we go to https:\/\/hub.meltano.com and download the file associated with the plugin.\n2. The downloaded definition file will be installed into `${MELTANO_PROJECT_DIR}\/plugins\/` as `${MELTANO_PROJECT_DIR}\/plugins\/extractors\/tap-mytap--variantname.yml`.\n3. An optional `plugin_definitions_path: <str>` config option in `meltano.yml` will allow users to change the default path. This would simply default to `${MELTANO_PROJECT_DIR}\/plugins` if not set by the user.\n    - This is separate from [include_paths](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/concepts\/project#multiple-yaml-files) in `meltano.yml`, since (1) we need to know exactly where to download new definitions and (2) the plugin definition files adhere to a new plugin spec format and not to the `meltano.yml` project format.\n4. After downloading the definition, the plugin entry will be added to `meltano.yml` exactly as is performed today.\n5. Instead of resolving setting definitions via `discovery.yml`, `meltano.yml` will only refer to the downloaded definitions.\n    - This will require a one-time update to our parser to also interpret and import data from the native\/standard plugin definitions from hub.meltano.com.\n\n#### Definition updates via `meltano add --upgrade`\n\nWe add something like `meltano add extractor tap-mytap --upgrade` which will replace the current definition with the new definition.\n\n#### Migration to locked definitions via `meltano install --lock` or `meltano install --freeze`\n\nFor projects already in the wild, we can add a `--lock` or `--freeze` option to `meltano install` which generates a \"locked\" plugin definition file for any which are missing. As above, this would create one file per plugin used in the project. If a plugin definition already exists, we skip adding that file.\n\n#### \"Single-file option\"\n\nI think we've declined this option so I'm collapsing it. Please sound off in comments if you have a strong preference otherwise.\n\n<details><summary>Click to expand<\/summary>\n\n~~As an alternative to downloading and adding files individually, we could follow basically the same behavior as described, except we import\/merge definitions in a single file called something at the root of the Meltano project dir like `plugins-registry.yml`, `registered-plugins.yml`, or `plugins-definitions.yml`. Since it would be a single file, we could have it at a fixed path relative to the root, and perhaps in the future allow the user to specify their own path to that file.\n\n(AJ Speaking) I'm personally less inclined towards the single-lock file approach after thinking on this more. The one-file-per-plugin approach creates cleaner file diffs and is more scalable for a large number of plugins.~~\n\n<\/details>\n\n#### Deprecating `discovery.yml`\n\nAfter implementing this proposal, `discovery.yml` as it exists today would be fully deprecated. Projects which have not yet had their definitions locked would still fall back to the bundled `discovery.yml` file. For the purposes of not breaking users on older versions, we would simply leave the online version of this file (https:\/\/discovery.meltano.com\/discovery.yml) frozen at a point in time without needing to continue maintaining updates in `discovery.yml`.\n\n#### Spec versioning\n\nAs @aphethean calls out in a thread on this issue https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3031#note_842196683, we also need to handle spec versioning so that the file spec can evolve without breaking users.\n\nFor instance, @aphethean provides a sample used by Kubernetes (`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io\/v1beta1`) and we can see something similar in `dbt`'s use of `config-version: 2`.\n\nThis makes sure we meet this requirement as expressed in the comment:\n\n> 1. \u2018meltano add extractor tap-csv\u2019\n> 1. Aeons later, tap-csv plugin definition will always work with my meltano project.","state":"closed","created_at":1635451940489,"updated_at":1652473544404,"closed_at":1652403886498,"closed_by":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

from the conversation in #2987 (internal), I thought it would be helpful to start discussing what configuration levels would be built into our Meltano IAC module for Terraform. To be sure that we have a specific-enough proposal without getting overwhelmed, I think we can describe this in AWS constructs _first_ and later translate these into the relevant constructs for GCP, Azure, etc.\n\n## Functional data project configuration\n\nThese inputs drive core functionality of the Meltano project:\n\n- `meltano_project_file` (str) - The path to a `meltano.yml` file to use in configuration of the environment. This would be [parsed by terraform](https:\/\/www.terraform.io\/docs\/language\/functions\/yamldecode.html) and may affect which resources Terraform creates, and how many. (Altering `meltano.yml` may require rerunning `terraform apply`.)\n- `meltano_project_dir` (str) - The path to the Meltano project folder containing job definitions, dbt transforms, etc.\n- `meltano_environment_name` (str) - The name of the environment to deploy, corresponding to a key in the `environments` entry in `meltano.yml`. This drives environment variable names and other configs as needed for the chosen environment. \n- `project_shortname` (str) - When AWS resources are created, they will be created with this text in the resource name.\n- `aws_region` (required, str) - The region ID (e.g. `us-east-2`)\n\nTo keep the config DRY, most\/all other configuration would ideally be migrated into _either_ the `environments` feature in `meltano.yml` _or_ the base plugin or utility config. Then `meltano.yml` (and possibly also `discovery.yml`) would be read as an input to the Terraform module's configuration.\n\n## Optional, AWS infrastructure reuse and interop:\n\nThese inputs are all optional, and they allow the Terraform module to reuse existing AWS resources if desired:\n\n- `use_existing_vpc_id` (optional, str) - The existing VPC ID to use. If null, a new VPC will be created.\n- `use_existing_private_subnets` (optional, list(str)) - The existing private subnets to use. If null, a new VPC will be created.\n- `use_existing_public_subnets` (optional, list(str)) - The existing private subnets to use. If null, a new VPC will be created.\n- `use_existing_s3_logging_path` (optional, str) - The S3 path to use for logging purposes, when S3 log location is needed. If not provided, a new S3 bucket will be created.\n- `use_existing_s3_artifacts_path` (optional, str) - The S3 path to use for storing temporary and long-term internal project artifacts, such as lambda function definitions, zip artifacts, and other internal project file storage. If not provided, a new S3 bucket will be created.\n\nThere may be more here but generally the config would follow the same pattern. In the first iterations, these may be all automatic - meaning we may not at first allow reusing existing resources. However, as the module matures, it should accept an increasing amount of interop and reuse with other environments, either for reasons of cost savings (RDS, K8 cluster, etc.) or corporate compliance policies (subnets, logging bucket, etc.). Most of these resources are free or have negligible cost, so probably would not need to prioritize reuse except for compliance reasons and for interop with existing application infrastructure.","state":"closed","created_at":1635142094807,"updated_at":1653904161660,"closed_at":1653904161643,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Discussion","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":797629,"iid":42,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Backlog","description":"As a start, I think it would be good to prioritize based on:\r\n- urgency of getting feedback\r\n- relative implementation difficulty\r\n- symbiotic relationships between issues","state":"active","created_at":"2019-02-21T14:50:28.741Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T14:50:28.741Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2019-02-25","expired":false,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/42"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3014","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3014","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3014\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3014\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3014","relative":"#3014","full":"meltano\/meltano#3014"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":124.0,"epic":{"id":348329,"iid":124,"title":"Deploying Meltano","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/124","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":95910043,"iid":3001,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Always print `--log-level=debug` guidance after failure","description":"In slack we are often providing the guidance that people can rerun their pipelines with `--log-level=debug` - generally needed when a tap or target cannot properly configure itself or fails auth.\n\nWhat do folks think about _always_ printing this after failure?\n\nSomething like:\n\n> .... has failed.

(#1673) \n\nThe proposed change is to add `jobs` construct, with one or more steps - similar to the proposal of a multi-step `meltano run` but stored in the yaml file and able to be scheduled.\n\nThis is essentially the translation of `meltano run` and `meltano invoke` statements into a DAG definition. Importantly, though, we need to be mindful of how much complexity we want to introduce.\n\nInstead of what we have now that is restricted to just EL pairs:\n\n- A schedule has a tap and target and transform spec (only\/skip\/etc.).\n\nWe'd have:\n\n- A named `job` has one or more `tasks`\n- A `schedule` points to a named `job` _or_ the `job` contains a `schedule` description\n- Optionally, we can choose to support parallel groups of tasks, such as invoking multiple taps together.\n  - Parallel groups might run serially if invoked locally via the CLI, but they'd generate a parallel structure when passed to an external orchestrator such as Airflow.\n\nThe assumption is that these would all run using `meltano run`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n- name: daily-eltp\n  tasks:\n  # EL pipelines can run in parallel:\n  - - tap-shopify target-snowflake\n    - tap-github target-snowflake\n  # These dbt build steps run in sequence:\n  - dbt:run --full-refresh\n  - dbt:test\n  # Last mile steps can run in parallel:\n  - - superset:build             # BI build\n    - tap-snowflake target-yaml  # reverse ETL can run in parallel with BI build\n- name: hourly-refresh\n  tasks:\n  - tap-slack target-snowflake\n  - dbt:run\n\n# schedules are separate and can reference jobs\nschedules:\n# ...\n```\n\n## Defining steps with rich metadata (out of scope for iteration 1)\n\nWe should plan for future support of rich task definitions (could have `name`, `type`, 'needs', etc.) instead of simple strings. \n\nThe shorthand of simple string representation is easy to understand, read, and maintain. However, this cannot handle advanced dag dependency representations. Supporting both smartly will likely be needed in future for advanced use cases:\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n- name: daily-eltp\n  tasks:\n  # A complex task object could be inlined with string-based tasks\n  - type: invoke\n    command: dbt:run\n    config: ... # perhaps overrides here or perhaps some other future syntax options\n  - dbt:test\n  - - superset:build             # BI build\n    - tap-snowflake target-yaml  # reverse ETL can run in parallel with BI build\n```\n\nFor each item in the tasks array, if the type is `string`, pass along basically as a `meltano run` arg. If the type is object (dict in python), then parse as a complex task.\n\n## Jobs' relationship to schedules\n\nSchedules likely should be environment specific, but perhaps this should be held until a future iteration.\n\n```yaml\nschedules:\n- name: daily-eltp-schedule\n  job: daily-eltp\n  interval: daily\n  environments:\n  - prod\n- name: hourly-refresh-schedule\n  job: hourly-refresh\n  interval: hourly\n  environments:\n  - prod\n  - dev\n#...\n```\n\n\n## Referencing a job from `meltano run`\n\nWe would expand `meltano run` to accept job names as well as plugin names.\n\nSo assuming 2 jobs are defined, `dbt-daily-refresh` and `daily-el-sync`, these invocations could be valid:\n\n_Possibly out of scope for first iteration_\n\n### Example A: EL steps followed by a named job.\n\nRuns one EL task and then all the tasks in the 'dbt-daily-refresh' job.\n\n```bash\nmeltano run tap-slack target-snowflake dbt-daily-refresh\n```\n\n### Example B: A job followed by a list of commands.\n\nRuns all the EL tasks in the `daily-el-sync` job and then run dbt.\n\n```bash\nmeltano run daily-el-sync dbt:run dbt:test\n```\n\n### Example C: Two sequential jobs.\n\nRuns all the tasks in the `daily-el-sync` job and then all the tasks in the 'dbt-daily-refresh' job.\n\n```bash\nmeltano run daily-el-sync dbt:run dbt:test\n```\n\n## Regarding name collisions\n\nIn order for jobs to be referenced in `meltano run`, there cannot be collisions between plugin names and job names.\n\n## CLI Interface\n\n#### jobs\n\n`meltano job <job_name>` add a job\n\n`meltano job <job_name> add schedule <interval>` Schedule the job\n\n`meltano job <job_name> add schedule '[<interval>, ...]' ` Add more schedules\n\n`meltano job <job_name> tasks <run commands>` # should this be set?\n\n`meltano job <job_name> tasks '[<run command>, ...]' `\n\n#### schedules\n\n`meltano schedule <schedule_name> set <job_name> <interval> <environment>` \n\n`meltano schedule <schedule_name> set <job_name>`\n\n`meltano schedule <schedule_name> set <interval>`\n\n`meltano schedule <schedule_name> set <environment>`\n\n`meltano schedule list [--format=json]`  Does this work with jobs that are scheduled via the job definition?\n\n`meltano schedule run <schedule_name>` Similar to current behavior this would pass any CLI args to `meltano run`\n\n### meltano run syntax\n\n\"Run\" would accept a job name in place of a command or plugin name.\n\n```\nmeltano run <job_name>\n```\n\nAnd job names and command\/plugin names can be sequenced:\n\n```\nmeltano run <job_name> dbt:run dbt:build\n```\n\nIn this scenario, everything runs sequentially but the user doesn't have to type as much.\n\n## Relation to `meltano invoke`\n\nJobs are not comatible with this syntax: `meltano invoke <job_name>`.\n\nInstead users should use `meltano run <job_name>` or `meltano schedule run <schedule_name` syntax.","state":"closed","created_at":1631033013852,"updated_at":1653903504483,"closed_at":1653903504460,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Discussion","Needs Refinement","OKR: Managed Meltano Beta","Office Hours::Discussed","Roadmap","kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/209"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":55,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2924","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2924","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2924\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2924\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2924","relative":"#2924","full":"meltano\/meltano#2924"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":116.0,"epic":{"id":331276,"iid":116,"title":"Enable ELT pipelines in Meltano to be composable","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/116","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":{"id":56416,"iid":56,"sequence":3,"group_id":2524164,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-05-13T20:04:48.839Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T00:05:02.370Z","start_date":"2022-05-23","due_date":"2022-05-29","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/iterations\/56416"},"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":93119602,"iid":2921,"project_id":7603319,"title":"meltano install fails in Ubuntu 20.04 LXD image unless you use venv","description":"### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\n`meltano install` works on my local env, running with a conda built python env.. but when i went to LXD based containers and wanted to use plain ol' python.. it crashed\n\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nmeltano install should work without needing venv or any other virtual environment..

By supporting lambda as a deployment option and orchestrator for Meltano we can provide an easy onramp into the Meltano ecosystem for customers already on AWS but otherwise unwilling to host and manage a self-deployed orchestrator like Airflow.\n\nIntegration would include:\n\n- A lambda-compatible docker container for Meltano\n- A way to manage state utilising only serverless services (DynamoDB, Aurora Serverless, S3 etc.)\n- A way to gracefully handle the 15min max execution time of Lambda.\n\nThere are several possible approaches to the final requirement:\n\n- Include a new `--max-execution-time` flag that terminates the tap gracefully (emitting state) even when more upstream records are available. This allows meltano to sync data using successive Lambda invocations without being 'reset' to a previous state due to timeouts, but carries the risk that streams fall behind and never catch up with the upstream source.\n- Parallelise pipelines using 'one stream per function' to minimise the risk of several streams in a single pipeline approaching the limit.","state":"closed","created_at":1630505460684,"updated_at":1653903405638,"closed_at":1653903405597,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Needs Refinement","flow::To Do","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2286180,"iid":206,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Q2-2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:22:10.509Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T17:51:23.679Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/206"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2911","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":40,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2911","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2911\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2911\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2911","relative":"#2911","full":"meltano\/meltano#2911"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":124.0,"epic":{"id":348329,"iid":124,"title":"Deploying Meltano","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/124","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":92846507,"iid":2908,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Support Deployment Plugins","description":"For Meltano to truly be a 'one-stop-shop' for your data platform, it needs to be able to deploy the individual tools and services that make up that platform.

field","description":"### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen adding a plugin with `--include-related`, Meltano adds a related file bundle plugin twice if it does not include the `update` field in its schema. The file bundles installs correctly if `update` is given with any key-value pair.\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe file bundle should be added only once with `--include-related`, regardless of whether or not the `update` field is provided.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Define a custom file bundle plugin (e.g. `files-google-analytics`) sharing a namespace of some other plugin (e.g. `tap-google-analytics` with namespace `tap_google_analytics`) **WITHOUT** any `update` field\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  repo: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n1. Add the file bundle via `--include-related` (e.g. `meltano add extractor tap-google-analytics --include related`)\n1. Observe file bundle (`files-google-analytics`) add twice, with two occurences of `Adding related file bundle 'files-google-analytics' to your Meltano project...` in the output log.\n\n### Relevant logs and\/or screenshots\n\n*Installs correctly*\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  update:\n    path\/to\/some\/file: true\n  repo: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  update:\n    path\/to\/some\/file: false\n  repo: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n*Installs incorrectly*\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  repo: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  name: files-google-analytics\n  namespace: tap_google_analytics\n  update: {}\n  repo: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n  pip_url: https:\/\/github.com\/me\/files-google-analytics\n```\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nIf `update` is not provided, Meltano [defaults it to an empty object (`{}`)](https:\/\/meltano.com\/docs\/plugins.html#update-extra), which I assume is the root cause of this bug. Specifying `update: {}` manually yields the same results.\n\n### Further regression test\n\n- [ ] Write additional adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team","state":"closed","created_at":1628588149104,"updated_at":1633048207075,"closed_at":1633048207060,"closed_by":{"id":1942272,"username":"tayloramurphy","name":"Taylor A Murphy","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/1942272\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/tayloramurphy"},"labels":["flow::Triage","kind::Bug","urgency::default","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2199293,"iid":188,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Fri: Oct 1, 2021","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-23T17:51:43.030Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T19:58:37.631Z","due_date":"2021-10-01","start_date":"2021-09-25","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/188"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

Some of these environments may be dynamically keyed and fully \"disposable\", such as \"cicd-<build_num>\", and \"dev-<person_id>\".\n\n## Today's Solutions\n\nToday there are two or three places where a user needs to specify their data platform information - for instance \"target-snowflake\" config, \"dbt profiles\", and the analyze config, and possibly a \"reverse-etl\" connector such as \"tap-snowflake\". There's not yet a meltano-native construct for reusing this config.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Environment config as a top-level construct\n\nWe propose adding a top-level `environments:` config element. This could be a combination of \"smart\" and \"passthrough\" settings, where \"smart\" settings are known and expected by meltano, and \"passthrough\" settings are anything that the target (or dbt profile) may require.\n\n### Environment Inheritance\n\nTo ease onboarding to support DRY principals - we should allow environments to inherit from each other. For instance, prod may be identical to dev except in the credentials and db name. Server name, and other connection-level parameters may be identical between these environments and we should allow the config to be reused - in the same way that the `inherits-from` construct supports this for plugins today.\n\n### Strawman Sample\n\nThis is only intended for conversation - the exact spec will evolve based on input:\n\n`meltano.yml`:\n\n```yaml\nproject_id: ...\nplugins: ...\nschedules: ...\nplugins:\n  extractors:\n  # this section unchanged - extractors referenced by name below in `sources`\n  - name: tap-github\n    namespace: tap_github\n    executable: tap-github\n    capabilities:\n    - state\n    - catalog\n    - discover\n    settings:\n    - name: searches\n      kind: array\n    - name: auth_token\n      kind: password\n    - name: start_date\n      value: '2010-01-01T00:00:00Z'\n  # ...\n\nenvironments:\n\n- name: prod\n  job_id_prefix: prod_             # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n\n  # The `destination` is the singular landing location (\"target\") for this environment\n  # Other environments inherit this destination and can customize either with `vars` or by overriding completely\n  default_loader: target-snowflake\n\n  enable_transforms: true  # or false if the target does not support transforms (e.g. target-jsonl or target-s3-csv)\n\n  # Here we list all the sources that `prod` should contain\n  # These reference names declared under `plugins->extractors`\n  # Other environments may inherit this list or override it\n  default_extractors:\n  - tap-github\n  - tap-zendesk\n  - tap-slack\n  - tap-github\n\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          db_name: \"${DB_NAME}\"                # References an environment-scoped env var\n          load_schema: \"${TAP_NAMESPACE}_raw\"  # Dynamic from the name of the currently-executing tap\n          account: \"${SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT}\"\n          user: \"${SNOWFLAKE_USER}\"\n          role: prod_loader_role\n          # ...\n\n  env:\n    # Env vars can be declared here when multiple plugins need to reference the same values\n    DB_NAME: \"Waffleshop_DB\"\n    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT: waffleshop.snowflakecomputing.net\n    SNOWFLAKE_USER: prod_loader\n\n- name: beta\n  job_id_prefix: beta_                       # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n  inherits_from: prod\n\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          role: beta_loader_role\n\n  env:\n    DB_NAME: \"Waffleshop_Beta\"\n    SNOWFLAKE_USER: beta_loader\n\n# The following environments are \"disposable\", meaning they are intentionally keyed for temporarily use\n\n- name: user_dev\n  job_id_prefix: dev_${USER}_                # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n  inherits_from: beta\n\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          role: beta_loader_role\n          load_schema: \"${USER}dev_${TAP_NAMESPACE}_raw\"        # Dynamic based on the USER environment variable\n\n  env:\n    DB_NAME: \"Development\"\n    SNOWFLAKE_USER: \"${USER}\"\n\n- name: cicd\n  job_id_prefix: cicd_b${GITHUB_BUILD_NUM}_  # will be appended with ${TAP_NAMESPACE} to make default job IDs\n  inherits_from: beta\n  sources:\n  config:\n    plugins:\n      extractors:\n      # Overrides to make CICD run faster using a subset of data\n      - name: tap-github\n        config:\n          searches:\n          - {name: \"target-athena\", query: \"target-athena+fork:only\"}\n          \n      loaders:\n      - name: target-snowflake\n        config:\n          role: cicd_loader_role\n          load_schema: \"raw_b${GITHUB_BUILD_NUM}_${TAP_NAMESPACE}\" # Dynamic based on build number from Github CI pipeline\n```\n\nIn the simplest interations, all of the environment's config would be available to invoked plugins via a name prefix such as `$MELTANO_ENV_{VAR_NAME}`, such as `$MELTANO_ENV_SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `$MELTANO_ENV_DB_NAME`. Importantly, since we expect to be toggling the environment back and forth at runtime, the generated environment variables would not have the name of the environment contained within the variable name. However, we probably could still expose the environment name itself in something like `$MELTANO_ENV_NAME`, in case a plugin has native configuration which can branch based on that name.\n\n### Possibility for native understanding of needs of different plugin types\n\nThe above is a simple \"passthrough\" approach where these keywords might not be natively understood by Meltano. However, we may choose to create subprofiles (now or in a future iteration) where meltano could send slightly different config to a transformer versus what it would send to a loader.\n\n## Best reason not to build\n\nNone I can think of. It is one level of additional config to setup, so we may want to ensure it is optional. Especially for EL-only pipelines where there are no further steps, we would not want a user to _necessarily_ need to configure an environment if they are happy with simple tap->target configuration as they perform today.","state":"closed","created_at":1627147542516,"updated_at":1639592911278,"closed_at":1635365235305,"closed_by":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

Instead, \"plugins\" `have` \"commands\" and \"commands\" `can be of type` \"test\". A command is of type `test` if its name starts with the word `test`.\n\n## Older Proposal (2021-10-27):\n\n* Discussion of the proposed spec from this comment thread: https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2838#note_682557413\n\n1. Already today: **Any plugin type can have a `test` command, added inline with other commands using existing command syntax.**\n1. Already today: Each test command is invocable directly and can perform its actions based on just environment vars and other context such as command line args.\n1. New: **Any plugin with a `test` command can also have a `tests:` list entry in the top-level plugin config.** Each item in the list of `tests` can have the following properties:\n    1. `name` - optional, if test is to be referenced by name\n    2. `executable` - optional, overrides the executable of the default `test` command at the plugin level\n    3. `args` - optional, overrides the args of the `test` command at the plugin level\n    4. `env` (or `vars`) - a list of env variable name\/value combinations to be passed to the executor\n1. New: Tests could be invoked with any of the following syntaxes:\n    1. `meltano run <plugin>:test` - runs any and all tests defined in the plugin declaration.\n        - If the `test` command exists but no `tests:` declaration, only the one test command will be executed.\n        - If the `tests:` entry also exists, all enumerated tests will be run in order.\n        - If the `test` command does not exist, the command fails.\n    2. `meltano test --all` (a new cli command) runs all defined tests in all plugins.\n    3. `meltano test <plugin>` runs all defined tests for the named plugin.\n    3. `meltano test <plugin1> <plugin2>` runs all defined tests for the named plugins.\n    4. `meltano test <plugin>:<test-name>` runs a named test for the named plugin.\n    4. `meltano test <plugin1>:<test-name1> <plugin2>:<test-name2>` runs multiple named tests for the named plugins.\n\nFuture Considerations:\n\nSequencing would need to be provided explicitly in the `v1` release, but `depends_on` behavior could be added in a v2, perhaps after `environments` (#2869) is released.\n\n\n<details><summary>Previous proposals, click to expand<\/summary>\n## Option A: Dedicated CLI command `meltano validate` (confirmed first iteration)\n\nThis would run validations as a dedicated top-level command. How the integration is performed would be governed by (a) custom code in meltano library and\/or (b) configuration specs in the `validators:` entry in `discovery.yml`.\n\n## Option B: Integration with `meltano elt` (won't do, deprecating in favor of `meltano run`)\n\nCould be enabled\/disabled similar to how transforms are treated, with a CLI flag.\n\n## Option C: Integration with (WIP) `meltano run` (will do, but in future iteration)\n\nCould be listed in a pipeline definition such as:\n\n`meltano run tap-salesforce target-snowflake dbt:test ge:test`\n\nGiven an invocation such as the above, Meltano may be able to infer that the two validators can run in parallel, and may automatically parallelize them.\n<\/details>","state":"closed","created_at":1625611330315,"updated_at":1639780903810,"closed_at":1639607211211,"closed_by":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

Before running the docker build, check if the docker hash already exists as a tag. If so, reuse the existing image in subsequent steps (skips the build time).\n    3. Create a manual build step which can be used to force docker image build a build even when nothing has changed.\n2. Running 'fail-early' tests redundantly without a fully-rebuilt docker image.\n    1. Start with a stock python image and\/or the image from the last stable master build.\n    2. Run `poetry install` - which should finish immediately if there's nothing to do.\n    3. Run at minimum `pytest [3.8]` and `python_lint [3.8]` using the older image.

The default behavior when `kind` is not know would be to treat the value as insensitive. We may instead want to prompt the user to specify the `kind` and\/or the sensitivity level of an otherwise undeclared setting value.\n\nFor instance, prompting a user to specify it if configuring with `meltano config <plugin> set <setting> <value>. Especially for custom taps (including many taps discovered from the hub), the `kind` and therefor the sensitivity level is not known, and we should probably not automatically default to that value _not_ being a secret. \n\nThis could also serve as a catch for typos or accidentally-incorrect setting names: rather than going through the wizard's steps and storing under the provided setting name, the user may realize they've input an incorrect setting name and abort, then retry the process with the correct setting name.\n\nHere's an example invocation. The result of the below (using an unknown\/incorrect setting name) is that the setting gets stored in yaml as clear text:\n\n```\n% poetry run meltano config target-jsonl set myset thisisnotasecret\nLoader 'target-jsonl' setting 'myset' was set in `meltano.yml`: 'thisisnotasecret'\n```\n\n\n## Proposal\n\n- We should at minimum warn the user that `kind` is missing.\n- If an interactive prompt is available, we can ask the user interactively what the proper `kind` value is _before_ serializing the new setting value.\n  - The setting's `kind` entry would be serialized to yaml as well.\n- We can add a `--quiet` flag optionally, to mute the new behavior and treat the setting as `kind: string` if not set. (Same as current status quo.)\n\n## Proposal (Updated 2022-04-16)\n\n- Combining with #3227+:\n  - If `--interactive` is used, we can _also_ prompt for setting config (including `kind`) at the same time as prompting for the new value.\n  - If `--interactive` is not set, we can fail with a prompt to use `--interactive` _or_ we can automatically switch to `--interactive` mode if `kind` is missing or the setting is not yet defined.","state":"closed","created_at":1622056974447,"updated_at":1653902322455,"closed_at":1653902322437,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Accepting Merge Requests","Configuration","Security","flow::Triage","kind::Tech Debt","urgency::high","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2286180,"iid":206,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Q2-2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:22:10.509Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T17:51:23.679Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/206"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2768","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2768","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2768\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2768\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2768","relative":"#2768","full":"meltano\/meltano#2768"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":123.0,"epic":{"id":338495,"iid":123,"title":"Improve CLI User Experience","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/123","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":87268193,"iid":2758,"project_id":7603319,"title":"`meltano invoke airflow` fails with `StrictVersion` error when Airflow is misconfigured","description":"When LocalExecutor set w\/ default SQLite meltano gives StrictVersion object has no attribute 'version' error. \nThe actual message should be something like that: \"error: cannot use SQLite with the LocalExecutor.\"","state":"closed","created_at":1621329049995,"updated_at":1626377275548,"closed_at":1626377275370,"closed_by":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"labels":["CLI","flow::Review","kind::Bug","urgency::higher","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2112410,"iid":171,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Fri: July 16, 2021","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-21T15:32:22.818Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T21:55:01.140Z","due_date":"2021-07-17","start_date":"2021-07-10","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/171"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

We could add a command like `meltano job rename <old_job_id> <new_job_id>`. `meltano job` could also later include `list`, which might be helpful for building a `tap-meltano` in the future if you want to use Meltano to track pipelines.  Alternate vocabulary could be `runs` instead of `jobs` as it seems like the codebase and docs are preferring that term.\n\nAnother way to do it would be to make a `meltano state` command to manage state. It could have `meltano state get <job_id>`, `meltano state set <job_id> <state>`, `meltano state reset <job_id>` (see #2568+). Then renaming could be something like `meltano state get <old_job_id> | meltano state set <new_job_id>`. Pipe syntax would be handy if you wanted to use a tool like `jq` to mutate states in complex ways.\n\nBoth of these options use a noun command as a verb command doesn't seem to make sense here. Currently Meltano seems to use a mix of verbs (`discover`, `init`, `install`, `upgrade`) and nouns (`user`, `schema`, `config`).\n\n### Proposal Update (2022-01-31)\n\n_(Appended by AJ.)_\n\nTo manage state migration, we'd add `get`, `set`, `clear`, and `copy` options a new `meltano state` command.\n\n1. `list`\n   - `meltano state list` (output list of available Job IDs to STDOUT)\n1. `set`\n   - `meltano state set <JOB-ID> <state-json-text>` (input from text string or STDIN)\n   - `meltano state set <JOB-ID> --input-file=<json-state-file>` (input from file)\n   - `cat state.json | meltano state set <JOB-ID>` (input from text string or STDIN)\n1. `show` (or `get`)\n   - `meltano state show <JOB-ID>` (output to STDOUT)\n   - `meltano state show <JOB-ID> > <json-state-file>` (output to file)\n1. `clear` (or `reset`)\n   - `meltano state clear <JOB-ID>` (or `meltano state reset`)\n1. `copy`\n   - `meltano state copy <JOB-ID-1> <JOB-ID-2>`\n1. `move`\n   - `meltano state move <JOB-ID-1> <JOB-ID-2>` (or `meltano state rename`)\n1. `merge`\n   - `meltano state merge <FROM-JOB-ID> <TO-JOB-ID>` (update job 2 state, replacing and merging status from job 1)\n\n### First iteration\n\nAs a first iteration, I think we'd just need items `#1-3`, which are `list`, `set`, and `show` - and optionally the fourth subcommand `clear`. With those three or four subcommands, users could accomplish the other functions in a multi-step processes. For instance, instead of `copy`, the user could run something like `meltano state show <OLD-ID> | meltano state set` and accomplish the same effect. Similarly, a `rename` operation could have the same workaround as `copy` except also running a manual `clear` after the copy.","state":"closed","created_at":1621015320150,"updated_at":1651249394289,"closed_at":1651101888993,"closed_by":{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/4025463\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/cjohnhanson"},"labels":["Accepting Merge Requests","CLI","Extract","OKR: Be the DataOps OS","Office Hours::Discussed","Roadmap","flow::Review","kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351598,"iid":208,"group_id":2524164,"title":"April 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:06.797Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T14:53:27.097Z","due_date":"2022-04-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/208"},"assignees":[{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/4025463\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/cjohnhanson"}],"author":{"id":689351,"username":"rabidaudio","name":"Charles Julian Knight","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e3f99640d60577f72086b54087423593?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/rabidaudio"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/4025463\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/cjohnhanson"},"user_notes_count":33,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":7,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2754","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":12,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2754","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2754\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/2754\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2754","relative":"#2754","full":"meltano\/meltano#2754"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":135.0,"epic":{"id":415886,"iid":135,"title":"meltano run improvements for meltano elt parity","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/135","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":86813182,"iid":2751,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Entity selection does not work when stream names have periods in them","description":"### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nI\u2019ve installed a custom plugin for redshift as an extractor (`pip install tap-redshift`). I had to do some debugging of their code but I got it working all except for the entity selection. When I do a `meltano select tap-redshift --list --all`, I get a list of all the tables in the `schema` set in my config. However, when I try to add model selection to the `meltano.yml` file using the expected syntax (i.e., `database.schema.table.*`), I can\u2019t get any of the entities in that list highlighted in green (\u2018selected\u2019) no matter what I do. It almost feels like the select cli command doesn\u2019t play nice with custom plugins.\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nIf I enter\n```\nselect:\n- database.schema.table.*\n```\nI would expect all columns in the listed table to be selected in green ('selected') after running a `meltano select --list --all` commmand.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nHere's my `meltano.yml`\n```\nversion: 1\nplugins:\n  extractors:\n  - name: tap-redshift\n    namespace: tap_redshift\n    pip_url: tap-redshift\n    executable: tap-redshift\n    capabilities:\n    - config\n    - discover\n    - catalog\n    - properties\n    config:\n      host: ############\n      port: 5439\n      dbname: matillion\n      schema: referencedata\n      start_date: 1900-01-01T01:01:01Z\n      user: ########\n      password: #########\n    select:\n    - 'matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.*'\n    metadata:\n      '*':\n        replication-method: FULL_TABLE\n\n```\n\n\n### Relevant logs and\/or screenshots\n```\n% meltano select tap-redshift --list --all                                   \nLegend:\n        selected\n        excluded\n        automatic\n\nEnabled patterns:\n        matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.*\n\nSelected attributes:\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.code_set_code\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.code_set_id\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.code_set_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.date_modified\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.modified_by\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.owner_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_code_set.steward_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.date_modified\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.lower_bound\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.metric_name\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.score_range_id\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.score_value\n        [excluded ] matillion.referencedata.t_ref_score_range.upper_bound\n```\n\nOn a separate note, the workaround I found was to use quotes and ignore the first couple of dots in the entity name.

solve\n\nI installed Meltano with tap-mysql and target-postgres. After creating some pipelines I realised that for a data set I needed to track deletions and this would require the transferwise variant. I switched the variant in the meltano.yml, but then spent a whilst trying to work out why it was not creating _sdc_deleted_at columns in postgres.\n\nThis is partially as I'm new, however the solution was to reinstall target-postgres with the transferwise variant. Everything then just worked, as you'd expect!\n\n\n### Proposal\n\nIt would really help (newer) users if the configuration validated the variant installed when it tried to run them.\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nIf the installed variant of a tap or a target does not match the variant in the meltano.yml then an error or warning should be shown.\n\n### Proposed spec (added 2022-03-03)\n\n1. During install we drop a marker file into the root of the venv with text of the `pip_url` used during installation. (Or a hash, if we think the pip_url is sensitive.)\n   - E.g. `.meltano\/...\/dbt\/meltano_pip_url_marker.txt`\n2. During execution we check the marker file against the current `pip_url` value.\n3.

If an env var is already set by that name, its value will be replaced by the setting value.\n\n\nFor example: if the OS context has an env var set as `DEBUG_MODE=1` but my plugin has a setting with `env: DEBUG_MODE` and setting value of `0`, then the plugin when invoked will have `DEBUG_MODE=0`, which is the value that the plugin is intended to receive by the Meltano user. ~~Any other env vars from context will be ignored _unless_ they are referenced under `value:`, `env_aliases:`, or the `config:` entry.~~ Any other env vars from context will be ignored _**when initializing the plugins settings**_ _unless_ they are referenced under `value:`, `env_aliases:`, or the `config:` entry.","state":"closed","created_at":1651011026516,"updated_at":1653667234985,"closed_at":1653667234970,"closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"},"labels":["kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"}],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3447","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3447","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3447\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3447\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3447","relative":"#3447","full":"meltano\/meltano#3447"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":136.0,"epic":{"id":421018,"iid":136,"title":"Meltano 2.0 Release","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/136","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 29, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":{"id":56416,"iid":56,"sequence":3,"group_id":2524164,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-05-13T20:04:48.839Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T00:05:02.370Z","start_date":"2022-05-23","due_date":"2022-05-29","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/iterations\/56416"},"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":107246486,"iid":3446,"project_id":7603319,"title":"dbt-snowflake fails with meltano run","description":"<!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n\nIf you are submitting an issue with a tap, please include:\n\n- account details\n- target details\n- entities selected  with meltano select (if you have selected any entities), as the bug may be related to a specific entity\n- the full elt command you are running\n- full output of the meltano elt command.

We can no longer reasonably scan all the plugins in the hub or in discovery.yml to identify matching namespaces and then have confidence that the matching plugins should be installed together. Instead, we need a more explicit mapping of files resources to the plugins that need those resources.\n\n## Proposed refactor:\n\n- The `namespace` field can be removed (optionally auto-calculated internally per #3374+).\n- Files resources are now defined inline with the plugins themselves.\n\n```yml\ntransformers:\n  - name: dbt\n    docs: https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/guide\/transformation\n    repo: https:\/\/github.com\/dbt-labs\/dbt-core\n    pip_url: dbt-core~=1.0.0 dbt-postgres~=1.0.0 dbt-redshift~=1.0.0 dbt-snowflake~=1.0.0 dbt-bigquery~=1.0.0\n    bundle: # or `depends_on:`\n      files:\n      - name: files-dbt  # Name might be optional, since the plugin has a name in its API definition.\n        # This is the API endpoint\n        ref: https:\/\/hub.meltano.com\/meltano\/api\/v1\/plugins\/extractors\/tap-zendesk--twilio-labs\norchestrators:\n  - name: airflow\n    docs: https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/guide\/orchestration\n    repo: https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/airflow\n    pip_url: 'apache-airflow==2.1.2 --constraint https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/apache\/airflow\/constraints-2.1.2\/constraints-${MELTANO__PYTHON_VERSION}.txt'\n    bundle:\n      files:\n      - name: airflow-files\n        variant: meltanolabs\n    settings:\n    # ...\n```\n\nThe files needed for the repo would then be self-contained within the plugin definition and are self-sufficient for installing the plugin, without needing external plugin to be installed.\n\n## Moving to `copier`\n\nOur current paradigm does not facilitate supporting changes over time to the files (the \"day 2\" problem). A related proposal would be to #3432+, but that can be delivered separately from this change.\n\n## Standalone `files` plugins\n\nWe can still support standalone `files` plugins for use cases where it still makes sense to do so apart from auto-installed resources for a `utility`, `transformer`, or `orchestrator` plugin.\n\nHowever, we would not post separate definitions to the hub for those `files` plugins which are best combined with their particular plugin.","state":"closed","created_at":1650755468151,"updated_at":1653917514443,"closed_at":1653917514422,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Office Hours::Discussed","kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/209"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

plugin","description":"\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nIf the metadata extra is defined in the base configuration of an inherited plugin it is not respected - the metadata from the base configuration of the parent plugin is used instead.\n\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nThe metadata extra from the inherited plugin definition should be used.\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nUsing the attached [meltano.yml](\/uploads\/3ddeb9658b37693e2edfe65519e970c2\/meltano.yml) run\n\n`meltano --environment=prod run tap-mysql2 target-jsonl`\n\nSomeTable2 will get replicated but with replication-method=LOG_BASED. If instead you run\n\n`meltano --environment=dev run tap-mysql2 target-jsonl`\n\nSomeTable2 will be replicated using replication-method=FULL_TABLE as expected. The point being that this appears to be a problem specifically with metadata defined on the base inherited plugin only.\n\nNote also that if you change the metadata in the base parent plugin to not use a wildcard, i.e.\n\n```   \n    metadata:\n      SchemaName-SomeTable:\n        replication-method: LOG_BASED\n```\n\nThe pipeline will fail with an error about the replication method not being defined for SomeTable2. I think that's relevant because it shows that the wildcard isn't overriding the inherited plugin configuration.\n\n### Further regression test\n_Ensure we automatically catch similar issues in the future_\n\n- [ ] Write additional adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team","state":"closed","created_at":1649967530938,"updated_at":1653917300157,"closed_at":1653917300139,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["User Support","kind::Bug","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/209"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

I wanted to use `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve` which are not supported as `dbt:x` syntax because its not listed in the [discovery.yml](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/bundle\/discovery.yml#L3073).

Logs can get pretty long, so you can add the full log as a snippet in the Meltano project and add a link in the issue.\n--->\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n_What is happening now?_\n\nWhen running my great_expectation tests using the `meltano test` command I get an error saying that Airflow isn't installed:\n```\nExecutable 'airflow' could not be found. Orchestrator 'airflow' may not have been installed yet using `meltano install orchestrator airflow`, or the executable name may be incorrect.\n```\n\nIts correct, Airflow is not installed which is on purpose because I'm not using it. It almost looks like its trying to run Airflow instead of great expectations. If I use `meltano invoke` instead of `meltano test` it works properly.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n_What should be happening?_\n\nThe test command shouldnt require anything thats not used.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n_How one can reproduce the issue?_\n\nmeltano, version 1.94.0\n\nThe meltano.yml is in the [squared repo](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/squared\/-\/blob\/master\/data\/meltano.yml#L314).\n\n```bash\nmeltano install utility great_expectations\nmeltano test great_expectations:test_ga_raw\n```\n\n###

Leave any entry blank to skip, \nor enter a new value. Password values will automatically be hidden \nfrom display for any settings of type 'password'.\n\nPress Ctrl+C to cancel at any time.\n\nSetting #1: project_dir\nDescription: The root dbt path.\nType: string\nDefault value: $MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT\/transform\nCurrent value: (none)\nNew Value: _ \n\n(skipped)\n\n....\n\nSetting #7: snowflake_user\nDescription: The username to use in Snowflake authentication.\nType: string\nDefault value: (none)\nCurrent value: (none)\nNew Value: snowflake_prod_user\n\nValue saved successfully to meltano.yml!\n\nSetting #8: snowflake_password\nDescription: The password to use in Snowflake authentication.\nType: password\nDefault value: $MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT\/transform\nCurrent value: (none)\nNew Value: ********** \n\nValue saved successfully to Meltano System DB!\n\n```\n\n## Spec Details\n\n- Interactive behavior is triggered bia the `--interactive` flag in `meltano config ... set`.\n- Interactive behavior can be triggered for a single setting or with `--all` to set all settings associated with the given plugin.\n- The `--all` option _requires_ the `--interactive` flag. If `--all` is specified without `--interactive`, Meltano should fail.\n- After each setting is set, Meltano should respond with `Value saved successfully to _<store>_!`\n  - The store could be `.env`, the SystemDB, or to Meltano.yml.\n  - Confirming and saving after each setting is set gives real-time feedback to the user about changes they have applied, and allows the remaining operation to be canceled without loss of any setting values already saved.\n- Individual settings should be skippable.\n- Password fields should either print asterisks or simply not echo anything while users are typing.\n- The new setting value should not be provided inline at the command line if `--interactive` is set. So, passing the setting value and also passing `--interactive` should cause Meltano to fail.\n\n## Ability to \"skip\" settings\n\nSkipping a setting may not be intuitive if done inline with the setting value input.\n\n```\nSetting #1: project_dir\nDescription: The root dbt path.\nType: string\nDefault value: $MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT\/transform\nCurrent value: (none)\nWould you like to set a new value? [Y\/n]: n\n\nSkipped.\n\nSetting #2: snowflake_user\nDescription: The username to use in Snowflake authentication.\nType: string\nDefault value: (none)\nCurrent value: (none)\nWould you like to set a new value? [Y\/n]: Y\nNew Value? []: snowflake_prod_user\n\nValue saved successfully to meltano.yml!\n\n...\n```\n\nWithout a separate prompt to skip or set the value, the user would generally have to type something like an empty string or `s` for skip, or similar. However, those are potentially valid answers to the new value prompt.\n\n## Phases\n\n- The initial merge should at minimum provide `--all --interactive` support.\n- Optionally, setting only one value (`--interactive` without `--all`) can be included in initial scope or added in a subsequent iteration.\n  - When setting only a single value, presumably we do not need to allow the \"skip\" option described above, since the user can simply abort (`ctrl+c`) to cancel if they do not want the value set.\n- Not required in this first iteration, but a future iteration should require users to first define a setting's type if the type is not yet set. Would be a path for resolving #2768+. For example, if the user runs `meltano config tap-snowflake set --interactive snowflake_password`, that should require the user to _first_ define the setting `kind` (kind is `password` in this case), which then drives correct parsing and storage of the provided value.","state":"closed","created_at":1644440493149,"updated_at":1653905726269,"closed_at":1653905726247,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty

If you've reached this template in error, please select another template from the list.)\n\n## Evergreen Releases - Prep Steps:\n\nAn `Evergreen` release process means we are _always_ releasing. We open a new release ticket as soon as we've completed the prior release. (It's therefore the final step in this checklist.)\n\n## \"Evergreen Prep\" Checklist\n\n- [x] Open this Issue\n- [x] Indicate the version to be released here in the issue's title `Release vX.Y.Z`\n    - If the release number changes (from minor to major or patch, for instance), update the version here and in the issue description.\n\n### Readiness Checklist:\n\n`Engineering` team, to get ready for the upcoming release:\n\n1. [x] Ensure any [already-merged commits](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/commits\/master) since the last release have [Changelog](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/CHANGELOG.md) entries (excepting non-user-impacting commits, such as docs fixes).\n2. [x] Create a comment in the `#engineering-team` slack channel with pending-but-not-merged MRs, potentially shipping. (Aka, the \"burndown\" list.)\n    - Otherwise a comment that all known merge candidates are already merged.\n3. [x] Create or link to a summary of MRs merged and\/or expected in the `#marketing` Slack channel, with an `@channel` mention.\n\n### Release Checklist\n\nRotating `assignee`, on the morning of the release:\n\n1. [x] Changelog updates and version bump:\n    1. [x] Check the [pending MRs](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/merge_requests?sort=updated_desc) to make sure nothing expected is still waiting to be merged.\n    2. [x] Create a [new branch](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/branches\/new) named `release\/vX.Y.Z` and a corresponding MR with the `Release` MR template.\n    3. An automated pipeline (linked to the branch prefix `release\/v*`) will\n    immediately and automatically bump the version and flush the changelog.\n        - [x] Check this box to confirm the automated changelog flush and version bump are correct.\n        - You _do not_ need to wait for the CI pipeline. (An identical CI pipeline is already included in the below.)\n2. [x] [Cut a release tag](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/tags\/new) from your `release\/vX.Y.Z` branch _(not from `main`)_ named `vX.Y.Z` with Message=`Release vX.Y.Z`\n    1. In response to new tag creation, these steps are performed automatically in Gitlab pipelines:\n        1. Abort if tag `vX.Y.Z` does not match output from `poetry version --short`\n        2. Test _everything_.\n        3. Publish to PyPi <!-- Meltano-only: and Docker -->.\n    2. Validate publish once the pipeline finishes. (While the process is running, you can continue with next steps, such as changelog grooming.)\n        1. [x] Check this box when the tag's [pipeline](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/pipelines) has completed (eta 40-60 minutes).\n        2. [x] Check this box when [PyPi publish](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/meltano\/#history) is confirmed.\n        <!-- Meltano-only: 5. [ ] Check this box when [Docker publish]() is confirmed. -->\n3. Groom the changelog:\n    1. [x] Compare the [Changelog](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/CHANGELOG.md) against the `main` branch [commit history](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/commits\/master) and add any significant user-impacting updates (excluding docs and website updates, for instance).\n    3. [x] Review the Changelog for readability and typoes, committing fixes or updates if needed.\n    2. [ ] Final changelog review:\n        - Open the Changelog in preview mode, mouse over each link and ensure tooltip descriptions match the resolved issue.\n        - Check contributor profile links to make sure they are correct.\n    3. [x] Merge the resulting MR to `main` with the merge commit message `Release vX.Y.Z`\n    4. [x] [Open the next `Release` issue](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/new?issue) using the `Release` template.\n\n### Announcements, Marketing, and Promotion\n\n`Marketing` or `Product` team:\n\n1.

Intention:\n\n> Meltano is responsible for managing the configuration of all of a project's plugins. It knows what settings are supported by each plugin, and how and when different types of plugins expect to be fed that configuration.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Discovery\n\nDiscovery is how Meltano \"knows what settings are supported by each plugin, and how and when different types of plugins expect to be fed that configuration\". This is done by:\n\n- Defining the settings available\/expected to be configured for a given plugin.\n- Defining the environment variables available\/expected to be configured for a given plugin via the `env` settings [key](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/schema\/discovery.schema.json#L653).\n- Defining default values for settings via the `value` [key](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/schema\/discovery.schema.json#L598). Note, default values can contain templated string references to environment variables (e.g. `$MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT\/utilities\/great_expectations`).\n\t- Which environment is `MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT` expected to be in? The Meltano runtime or the plugin runtime? \ud83e\udd2f \n- Defining env var maps to predictable names via the `env_aliases` [key](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/schema\/discovery.schema.json#L661) for reuse across types of plugins (now marked as deprecated \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f). (e.g. `TAP_POSTGRESS_HOST` > `PG_ADDRESS`).\n- Defining settings aliases via the `aliases` [key](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/schema\/discovery.schema.json#L581) as alternative names by which the setting can be configured in `meltano.yml` and the CLI. This is often done to 'prettify' or make uniform with other plugin variants (e.g. `postgres_host` > `host`). **Note:* Meltano does not currently look for env vars of the form `<plugin name>_<alias name>` by default (though sunch env vars can be specified as `env_aliases` manually), nor does it appear to check or warn of clashes as the result of settings referenced in multiple ways (by its `name`, `aliases` or `env_aliases`).\n\nIn addition to the behaviours implemented as part of discovery, Meltano has 2 other builtin mechanisms for handling\/discovering settings:\n\n- [Pipeline environment variables](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/guide\/integration#pipeline-environment-variables) define settings that are passed from the environment of one plugin to the next in a pipeline (e.g. `extractor>loader>transformer`).\n- [Plugin extras](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/guide\/configuration#plugin-extras) define settings used to configure the behaviour of specific plugin types _before_ and _after_ 3rd party code is invoked. This works by passing `plugin_extra` settings for use by all subclasses of [`BasePlugin`](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/plugin\/base.py#L246) (e.g. extras available to the [`SingerTap`](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/plugin\/singer\/tap.py#L104) allow users to [override](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/plugin\/singer\/tap.py#L302) the `catalog.json` path used during Tap invocation).\n\n### Configuration\n\nConfiguration is how end-users populate discovered settings with their own values. Config is done by:\n\n- Using the `meltano config ...` CLI and `meltano.yml` to configure the above settings by name.\n- Using environment variables in the Meltano runtime to configure the above settings via a `<PLUGIN NAME>_<SETTING_NAME>` env var naming convention. Environment variables can either be `export`'d into the Meltano runtime or coded in a `.env` file automatically discovered by Meltano.\n-  Using values stored in the Meltano [system database](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/concepts\/project#system-database) to configure settings by name (also available through the UI).\n-  Using the `env:` key of the [environments](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/concepts\/environments) feature to inject arbitrary environment variables into a plugins environment. These env vars will also be passed to subsequent stages in a pipeline according to the [pipeline environment variables](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/guide\/integration#pipeline-environment-variables) feature.\n\t- How are duplicates\/clashes handled?\n-  Setting env vars in the Meltano runtime environment matching names specified in setting `env:` and `env_aliases:` discovery keys (that do not have to conform to the `<PLUGIN NAME>_<SETTING_NAME>` conventions) to inject values into the plugins environment. **Note:** this is now an undesired behaviour, as per [#2984](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2984).\n-  Referencing provided [pipeline environment variables](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/guide\/integration#pipeline-environment-variables) in plugin tools code (e.g. the [provided profiles.yml](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/files-dbt\/-\/blob\/master\/bundle\/transform\/profile\/profiles.yml))\n-  Using `plugin_extras` to configure the pre and post invocation behaviours of plugins.\n-  Mapping a setting to an environment variable by adding a `my_setting: ${MY_ENV_VAR}` mapping under the `config:` block in `meltano.yml` or via the CLI using `meltano config <plugin> set my_setting \"${MY_ENV_VAR}\"`.\n\t- Which environment is `MY_ENV_VAR` expected to be in? The Meltano runtime or the plugin runtime? \ud83e\udd2f \n\n## FAQ's\n\n- What is the difference between `config` and `settings`?\n\n\tSettings are specified as part of plugin definitions for the purposes of discovery. Config is the mechanism by which the fields described as settings are populated with values.\n\n\tWhilst `settings` usually only appear in `discovery.yml`, custom plugins added in `meltano.yml` places `settings` and `config` in the same view, which is completely baffling.\n\n- How does `config` specified in `meltano.yml` arrive in files inside a plugins runtime? e.g. Singers' `config.json` or dbts' `profiles.yml`?\n\n\tFor Singer the `SingerPlugin` class `src\/meltano\/core\/plugin\/singer\/base.py` has a method (decorated as a `before_configure` Hook) for [writing a valid config.json file]() and another for [removing the file after](). Config arrives via an instance of the `PluginSettingsService` instantiated with both project and plugin.\n\t\n\tFor dbt (specifically `profiles.yml` the approach is slightly different. dbt supports the retrieval of env vars within its config files (using jinja templating syntax). Therefore we need only match the env vars specified in the [provided profiles.yml](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/files-dbt\/-\/blob\/master\/bundle\/transform\/profile\/profiles.yml) to those available inside the Transformers environment. To smooth over this injection of env vars, Meltano makes available all the env vars provided to the Loader available to the Transformer as well, as part of the [pipeline environment feature](https:\/\/docs.meltano.com\/guide\/integration#pipeline-environment-variables). Currently we prescribe env vars of the form `PG_*` in the file bundle, but any matching env var name could be used (e.g. `TARGET_POSTGRES_*` to match the Loader env var convention).\n\n- How do we determine what `settings`, specified in discovery, should be environment variables vs. which should be injected into files?\n\n\tThis is implemented using the `env:` and `env_aliases:` keys in `discovery.yml`. Details as per Douwes comment [here]:\n\t\n\t> The behaviour around `env` and `env_aliases` is implemented in [`SettingsService.setting_env_vars`](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/plugin\/settings_service.py#L63), which takes a `for_writing` boolean (which is `False` by default). Writing here means writing into the plugin's execution env, not-writing means reading from Meltano's execution env to populate a setting (that may then be written into the plugin execution env later). That `for_writing` flag is passed to [`SettingDefinition.env_vars`](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/blob\/master\/src\/meltano\/core\/setting_definition.py#L174) as `include_custom`. Following the logic there shows that when reading from the env, only the auto generated `<prefix>_<name>` is checked, and when writing into the env, env and env_aliases are used as well. I think the logic is that we want Meltano users to always use `<prefix>_<name>` consistently, but the plugin itself may expect a different env var.\n\t\n\tThis description does not appear to explain the case described by [#2984](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2984), which sparked our efforts to deprecate `env:` and `env_aliases:` in the first place \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n## Proposed Next Steps\n\n- To resolve  [#2984](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2984) I believe we should remove the ability of the `SettingsService` to retrieve for injection any env vars _other than_ those matching the `<plugin name>_<setting name>` convention from the Meltano runtime environment. This meets Douwes intent that:\n\n\t> we want Meltano users to always use `<prefix>_<name>` consistently, but the plugin itself may expect a different env var.\"\n\n- Implement a check to determine if any arbitrary env vars configured in `environments.[].env` do not clash with `env:` and `env_aliases:` defined in discovery. Warn or error if clashes are found.\n\n- Provide guidance\/docs on the usage on `env:` and `env_aliases:` keys in discovery. AJ suggests:\n\t\n\t> General plugins vs Singer plugins: General plugins must get some of there config from env vars; Singer plugins should not need env vars - but some do. Following from this:\n\n\t> - It's a healthy pattern for General plugins to declare `env:` entries to pass along settings to the plugin context (but probably not `env_aliases:`).\n\t> - It's a discouraged pattern for Singer plugins to declare `env:` entries. (We'll support if needed, but we should keep an eye on them and this should be the exception rather than the rule.)\n\t> - To avoid confusion around which env entries are needed for Singer plugins to function - versus which are convenient aliases, I think we should remove `env_alias:` entries from Singer plugins, replacing them with env: entries and an explanatory comment with issue link perhaps.\n\n### Description V1\n\nQuick summary of recent findings:\n\n1. `env_aliases` \/ `env` - These are the same functionally. (New info to everyone!) - these fit the description as recently added in the JSON Schema for `env:`:\n    - > `An environment variable that will be initialized with the setting's value whenever the plugin is invoked. This is used to inject environment variables into the plugin's execution context. If the named environment variable is already defined at runtime, Meltano will use the passed value from context instead of the configured value.`\n    - Essentially a two-way read and write to\/from the env variable.\n2. The `env_alias` and `env` entries also have a special role in seeding `dbt_profiles.yml`. Specifically `PG_ADDRESS`, etc. I think (to confirm?) this is part of the reason dbt cannot be run on its own: because if the target wasn't invoked, those settings don't exist.\n3. Settings aliases - newly discovered! Similar to `env_aliases` but at the setting level.\n    - To be confirmed: if these are compatible with env injection in the form `<PLUGIN_NAME>_<SETTING_ALIAS>`. More in #3209.\n4. `config` vs `settings`: `settings` are the plugin definition (optionally with default values) and `config` is one project's settings values.\n5. When a user wants to map a setting to an environment variable, the recommended way of doing so is probably to add a `my_setting: ${MY_ENV_VAR}` mapping under the `config:` block.\n6. General plugins vs Singer plugins: General plugins _must_ get some of there config from env vars; Singer plugins should not need env vars - but some do. Following from this:\n    - It's a healthy pattern for General plugins to declare `env:` entries to pass along settings to the plugin context (but probably not `env_aliases:`).\n    - It's a discouraged pattern for Singer plugins to declare `env:` entries. (We'll support if needed, but we should keep an eye on them and this should be the exception rather than the rule.)\n    - To avoid confusion around which env entries are needed for Singer plugins to function - versus which are convenient aliases, I think we should remove `env_alias:` entries from Singer plugins, replacing them with `env:` entries and an explanatory comment with issue link perhaps.\n\n------------------------\n\nAs per office hours 2022\/02\/02, the current mechanism of declaring an environment variable to be populated within plugin `settings` using `env:` and `env_alias:` causes confusion to even experienced Meltano users.\n\nFrom the jsonschema:\n\n```json\n\"env\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"description\": \"An environment variable that will be initialized with the setting's value whenever the plugin is invoked. This is used to inject environment variables into the plugin's execution context. If the named environment variable is already defined at runtime, Meltano will use the passed value from context instead of the configured value.\",\n    \"examples\": [\n        \"DBT_PROFILES_DIR\",\n        \"GE_HOME\"\n    ]\n}\n\n\"env_aliases\": {\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"description\": \"Deprecated. Use to delegate alternative environment variables for overriding this setting's value\",\n    \"examples\": [\n        \"TAP_ACCOUNT_ID\",\n        \"TAP_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER\"\n    ],\n    \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSpecifically, from `env`,:\n\n> If the named environment variable is already defined at runtime, Meltano will use the passed value from context instead of the configured value.\n\nThis causes unexpected behaviours for users not aware of this dual behaviour. We propose that, in stead of relying on `env:` for both purposes (sourcing values to inject _and_ determining the target env var name to inject into), we simply remove the sourcing behaviour. This would mean Meltano would no longer search its runtime environment for matching env var names to retrieve values, effectively making any settings with `env:` specified an \"environment variable type setting\" (as suggested by @tayloramurphy [here](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/merge_requests\/2505#note_829519083)). Sourcing of values would only be possible via the standard mechanisms; explicit `config:` or env vars in the Meltano runtime of the form `<plugin name>_<setting name>`.\n\n`env_aliases` might be kept to allow one setting to be mapped to multiple env vars. E.g.\n\n```yaml\nsettings:\n- name: aws_profile\n  env: AWS_PROFILE\n  env_aliases: [AWS_DEFUALT_PROFILE]\n```\n\nor both could be replaced with an array-type `env_vars:` e.g.:\n\n```yaml\nsettings:\n- name: aws_profile\n  env_vars: [AWS_PROFILE, AWS_DEFUALT_PROFILE]\n```\n\nIt is also worth considering if these settings should be injected as keys in config files either. Not doing so would further increase the specificity of the settings function as \"an environment variable created from a Meltano setting\".\n\n### Possible Challenges\n\n- Users can also set environment variables directly using the `env:` key in the `--environment` feature. This produces two ways to achieve the same outcome, and may cause conflicts and confusion to users. This can be handled with a resolution order (preferring settings above environment variables) and\/or by warning\/erroring if the same env var is specified by the two methods.","state":"closed","created_at":1643889884695,"updated_at":1651266791414,"closed_at":1651266791395,"closed_by":{"id":1942272,"username":"tayloramurphy","name":"Taylor A

For sensitive credentials I set them in the .env while non-sensitive environment specific settings (like schema_name) get set at the meltano.yml environment level.\n\nThe functionality I want is to be able to combine both sensitive and non-sensitive variables for use in a plugin as an environment variable. A use case is in the squared repo where we have an Athena connection string used in Great Expectations and Superset:\n\n`awsathena+rest:\/\/[YOUR_AWS_KEY]:[YOUR_AWS_SECRET]@athena.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/[YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME]?s3_staging_dir=s3:\/\/[YOUR_S3_PATH]`\n\nI want to be able to set the secret keys in my .env and the path and schema in my meltano.yml environment. Right now templating is supported in meltano.yml for config values using environment variables but for some plugins, especially utilities, configs arent useful and we need to be building environment variables that the utility can access. Templating doesnt seem to be supported at the `env` level underneath the `environment` key. So right now I can set secrets in the .env and non-sensitive variables at the `environment.env` level in meltano.yml but I have no way of blending the two to pass along to a plugin, so I end up building the connection string multiple times in the plugins vs defining it once.\n\nIdeas: Add an `env` key to plugin configs that allows you to use templating to build a new environment variable at the plugin\/environment level. Or...allow templating at the current `env` key level based on whats in your .env file.\n\n## Update (2022-05-05)\n\nScope of this issue is now to:\n\n* Write tests based on the spec in the [Miro Board](https:\/\/miro.com\/app\/board\/uXjVO3j_ADw=\/)\n* Fix anything that fails tests\n* Update documentation to clarify inheritance\n\n## Update (2022-05-03)\n\n**Relevant [Miro Board](https:\/\/miro.com\/app\/board\/uXjVO3j_ADw=\/) where we're whiteboarding all of this**\n\n## Spec Update (2022-04-08)\n\nNote: this updated spec follows from my comment here: https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3173#note_817409586\n\n### Problem statement:\n\nCurrently, env variables at different levels of the code cannot necessarily rely on each other or build upon each other.\n\n### Proposed solution:\n\nWe would define environment variable inheritance to be valid across these layers, in this strict order:\n\n- Level 1: terminal context (inherited either via `.env` or via shell env vars)\n- Level 2: top-level `env:` declarations within `meltano.yml`\n- Level 3: environment-level `env:` declarations.\n- Level 4: `env:` declarations within top-level plugin definitions.\n- Level 5: `env:` declarations within environment-scoped plugin definitions.\n\n### Example\n\nThis shows how inheritance would be expected to function across the 5 named levels. (Could be a unit test during development.)\n\n`.env`\n\n```sh\n# Level 1: terminal context\n# Inherits from none\nLEVEL_NUM=\"1\"\nSTACKED=\"1\"\n```\n\n```yml\nenv:\n  # Level 2: top-level `env:`\n  # Inherits from terminal context\n  LEVEL_NUM: \"2\"                  #  '2'\n  STACKED: \"${STACKED}2\"          # '12'\nplugins:\n  extractors:\n    tap-foobar:\n      env:\n        # Level 4: plugin-level `env:`\n        # Inherits from a environment-level `env:` if an environment is active\n        # Inherits directly from top-level `env:` if no environment is active\n        LEVEL_NUM: \"4\"            #    '4'\n        STACKED: \"${STACKED}4\"    # '1234'\nenvironments:\n  prod:\n    env:\n      # Level 3: environment-level `env:`\n      # Inherits from top-level `env:`\n      LEVEL_NUM: \"3\"              #   '3'\n      STACKED: \"${STACKED}3\"      # '123'\n  plugins:\n    extractors:\n      tap-foobar:\n        env:\n          # Level 5: environment-level plugin `env:`\n          # Inherits from (global) plugin-level `env:`\n          LEVEL_NUM: \"5\"          #     '5'\n          STACKED: \"${STACKED}5\"  # '12345'\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q. Why does the global plugin level config (level 4) inherit from the environment-level config?**\n\nA: This is counterintuitive at first but actually quite necessary.\n\nImagining that the plugin settings globally include a call to `$SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME` and imagine that each environment has its own value for `SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME: ___` in the respective `env:`. We don't want each environment to have to redundantly declare the plugin properties but we _do_ want to use the `$SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME` value that is most appropriate from the given execution context. Hence, the global-level plugin can be defined once to leverage whatever value is in `$SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME` and the plugin's configuration will still be seeded properly according to which environment is active.\n\n## Providing level info for research\/debugging\n\nPerhaps in the `dry-run` proposal in #3146, it would be good to print where each environment variables are sourced. We will need to do this without exposing sensitive values.\n\nSo, if the example above were real, we might get debug info such as:\n\n```\nmeltano run --dry tap-foobar target-snowflake\nPrinting debug info in response to `--dry` CLI argument. No actions will be executed.\n\nThe plugin `tap-foobar` was declared with the following context:\n\n- env:LEVEL_NUM - derived from the following, in order of precedence:\n    - environments[prod].plugins[tap-foobar].env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - plugins[tap-foobar].env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - environments[prod].env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - shell.env[LEVEL_NUM]\n...\n```\n\nOr perhaps a more realistic example:\n\n```\nmeltano run --dry tap-foobar target-snowflake\nPrinting debug info in response to `--dry` CLI argument. No actions will be executed.\n\nThe plugin `tap-foobar` was declared with the following context:\n\n- 'tap-foobar.config[username]' was derived from the following, in order of precedence:\n    - environments[prod].env[FOOBAR_USERNAME]\n    - env[FOOBAR_USERNAME]\n...\n```\n\nIn the above example, the 'prod' declaration of `FOOBAR_USERNAME` clobbers the global one. The user can infer from this printout that their `prod`-level config is working correctly, and if they were to remove the prod-level config, they'd get the value of the top-level `env:` declaration.\n\n## Related Topics\n\nMore discussion on this can and probably should be moved to a follow on issue, but for completeness:\n\n### Further detail and settings-level `env:` declarations (`level 6`)\n\nNot listed above, but a plugin setting may have `env:` declared, which operates differently from the other layers. This `plugin.settings[].env:` declaration simply accepts a string as env variable name, and the specified setting value will get injected and sent _into_ the plugin's subprocess. \n\n- This functionality is required in order to have plugins behave as expected. Non-singer plugins don't receive a `config.json` so the env variable injection is the substitute.\n- I think the `env:` function at the setting layer should _always_ be a pure child process injection (clobbering any existing env var but not reading from it).\n- We should probably stop this layer 6 from _also_ sourcing data from layers 1-5, and instead make it a pure one-way injection into the plugin context. As described in #3447+\n- I do not know if the current status quo for an existing `env` variable value will clobber an explicitly defined config value, or if the config value would clobber the env variable value, essentially replacing the env var value within the plugin's child process.","state":"closed","created_at":1642707637477,"updated_at":1653905327482,"closed_at":1653905327462,"closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/11629953\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Office Hours::Discussed","flow::Triage","kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/209"},"assignees":[{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/4025463\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/cjohnhanson"}],"author":{"id":8668050,"username":"pnadolny13","name":"Pat Nadolny","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/8668050\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/pnadolny13"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/4025463\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/cjohnhanson"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3173","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3173","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3173\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3173\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3173","relative":"#3173","full":"meltano\/meltano#3173"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":136.0,"epic":{"id":421018,"iid":136,"title":"Meltano 2.0 Release","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/136","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 29, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":{"id":56416,"iid":56,"sequence":3,"group_id":2524164,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-05-13T20:04:48.839Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T00:05:02.370Z","start_date":"2022-05-23","due_date":"2022-05-29","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/iterations\/56416"},"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":100981585,"iid":3172,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Legacy python 3.6 compatibility code","description":"With the dropping of python 3.6 support in #2991, I also had a very quick search through the codebase to find comments that referenced 3.6 compatibility hacks:\n\n```\n(melty-3.8) \u279c  meltano git:(2991-python-3-6-eol) \u2717 grep \"3\\.6\" * -r | egrep -v \"\\.js|.vue|.lock|\\.svg|.node_modules|\\.log|Binary file|CHANGELOG\"\nsrc\/meltano\/core\/plugin_install_service.py:        #

transformers\" aka \"stream maps\" aka \"map transforms\"","description":"In preparation for #2299 (and\/or the similar #2300), we should discuss what to call these things. We especially should consider how the naming decisions will impact (1) the new user experience and (2) possibly overlap or confusion regarding other existing plugins and interactions.\n\n## Background Context\n\n### History of \"Stream Maps\" naming within the SDK\n\nWhen developing the Stream Maps feature in the SDK, one very important paradigm which allowed that effort to move forward was the concept of the \"Map\" process of a \"Map-Reduce\" paradigm. While the word \"tranformation\" can mean anything in the set of operations {Map\/Reduce\/Lookup\/Filter\/etc.}, we are limited in an inline capacity to basically these two: Map and Filter. (Lookups are possible in an inline capacity but they are very different than lookups which occur in SQL, and as such they are extremely expensive and require a robust caching strategy that is far beyond our scope.)\n\nSo, \"Stream Maps\" naming or \"Map Transforms\" naming was intended to highlight the focus on operations which can be performed scalably in an _inline_ capacity. **Unlike \"true\" transform tools like dbt, we do not have all of the data available before we execute; we have only one record at a time and we must be able to treat each record in isolation before passing it downstream (or not).**\n\nLegacy ETL tools tried to do any and all type of \"big T\" transform functions `{Map\/Reduce\/Lookup\/Filter\/etc.}` before passing data downstream to the target, which although more rare now is still a problem in the industry using existing tools like Informatica, SSIS, Alteryx, Azure Data Factory, etc. This \"traditional\/legacy ETL\" approach is an anti-pattern for very good reason and we should be very clear we are _not_ supporting it.\n\n### Why not just call them \"transformations\" or \"transforms\"\n\nIf applying a little \"m\" for a lightweight inline map transform, `ELT` becomes `EmLT`. Note the little `m` and the big `T` are entirely different capabilities, with different performance constraints and resource availability. We _do not_ want to confuse users by saying this is okay: `ETLT` - this would be a huge step backwards in terms of DataOps best practices, and would cause detrimental confusion to end users if they think there's no difference between \"transform\" in the middle of EL and the \"transform\" in the SQL\/dbt layer.\n\nWhen we speak of these conversationally, we use the word \"transformations\" often. However, the name collision with dbt (the *true* \"T\" in \"ELT\" pipeline, is extremely problematic - the `m` and `T` perform very different functions, with different physics constraints, latency expectations, and host server hardware profiles. They also have very different risk profiles for data loss in case of code errors or other unexpected failure.\n\n## Option A: `mappers` are a new plugin type, with associated `mappings` entries in `meltano.yml`\n\nSimilar to as written up in #2299:\n\n```shell\nmeltano add mapper meltano-map-transform\nmeltano add mapper pipelinewise-transform-field\n```\n\n```yml\n# meltano.yml\nmappers:\n- name: meltano-map-transform\n  pip_url: meltano-map-transform\n  config:                         # Optionally, a default config.\n    # ...\n- name: pipelinewise-transform-field\n  pip_url: pipelinewise-transform-field\nextractors:\n- name: tap-gitlab\n  # ...\n  mappings:\n  - name: pii-hasher               # The name of the map transform to apply.\n    mapper: meltano-map-transform  # The mapper plugin to use.\n    config:                        # What will be sent to the transformer in a config.json file.\n      stream_maps:\n        customers:\n          id_hashed: md5(record['id'])\n          id: None\n```\n\nOption B: Transformers are of a `type`: `streaming` or `build`\n\nAnother (admittedly less preferred) option would be to allow `mappers` into the family of `transformer` utilities but with the addition of a new `type` attribute which specifically distinguishes them from other transformation types.\n\nThe `dbt` transformer would be something to indicate it has all data landed in the target upfront, such as `build` or `post-load`.\n\nThe `mapper` transformers would have some `type` value indicating their place as map-transforms and not full fledge data build\/transform\/aggregation tools. Possible values for `type` could be: `streaming`, `inline`, `mapper`, or `stream_map`.\n\ncc @tayloramurphy, @edgarrmondragon, @pandemicsyn, @kgpayne","state":"closed","created_at":1639603667594,"updated_at":1645571273973,"closed_at":1639694655398,"closed_by":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"labels":["Discussion","Plugin Management","flow::Review","kind::Non-Product"],"milestone":{"id":2286172,"iid":200,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Fri: Dec 17, 2021","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:20:21.743Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T16:10:50.410Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-12-11","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/200"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3123","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3123","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3123\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3123\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3123","relative":"#3123","full":"meltano\/meltano#3123"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":116.0,"epic":{"id":331276,"iid":116,"title":"Enable ELT pipelines in Meltano to be composable","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/116","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"},{"id":99104978,"iid":3122,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Add a default Environment when `meltano init` is invoked","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIncrease awareness and use of the [`Environments` feature](https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/2869) by including a default `environments: ...` entry in `meltano.yml` for new projects.\n\n### Target audience\n\nUsers starting fresh new Meltano projects.\n\n### Further details\n(Include use cases, benefits, and\/or goals)\n\n- New projects get the benefits of having at least one declared environment in `meltano.yml`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAn initial set of environments that might be sensible is:\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n- name: dev\n  config:\n    plugins: {}\n  env: {}\n- name: prod\n  config:\n    plugins: {}\n  env: {}\n```\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWe should see an increased use of `environments` for new projects.\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links \/ references","state":"closed","created_at":1639592910924,"updated_at":1645121692803,"closed_at":1645019061808,"closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"},"labels":["flow::Review","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2286177,"iid":204,"group_id":2524164,"title":"February 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:21:35.408Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T20:28:25.106Z","due_date":"2022-02-28","start_date":"2022-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/204"},"assignees":[{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"}],"author":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

I propose we remove these from `discovery.yml` and instead direct users to use the explicit environment variable logic: `<plugin_name>_<setting_name>`.\n\nOptionally, we can preserve this functionality in case users want to add their own mappings within their `meltano.yml` files, but to my understanding, this is fully redundant with just setting the config value to be equal to the value (e.g. `value: $MY_ENV_VAL` is basically equivalent to adding the `env: MY_ENV_VAL` or `env_aliases: [MY_ENV_VAL]`).\n\nAs I understand the evolution of this featureset, the custom-named env variable aliases existing prior to the newer `<plugin_name>_<setting_name>` parsing convention. Since adding that newer convention, I think we have seen this convention go mainstream for most use cases, and we run into problems with those legacy variable names being confusing user experience if the ingestion is not expected, and\/or if the order of resolution is surprising to users. See #2984 for more info on this.\n\n## Update (2022-01-24)\n\nFollowing from the notes in !2507+, we think that `env:` is serving a different function, and so this deprecation should only affect `env_aliases`.

This is true even for mainstream packages like Postgres. https:\/\/docs.getdbt.com\/dbt-cli\/install\/pip\n\n## Proposal: use an adapter-specific plugin name\n\nThese examples all use Snowflake as an example, but we would support 4 adapters at launch (same as supported today):\n\n- `dbt-bigquery`\n- `dbt-redshift`\n- `dbt-postgres`\n- `dbt-snowflake`\n\n### Installation\n\n```console\n> meltano add transformer dbt-snowflake\nInstalling `dbt-snowflake`...\nInstall completed.\n```\n\n### New user experience \n\n1. A new user installing `dbt-snowflake` for the first time, would following the installation instructions above: `meltano add transformer dbt-snowflake`.\n2. After installing the dbt-snowflake transformer, they'd have 3 auto-created profiles in the auto-installed `profiles.yml` for `dbt`: 'prod', 'beta', and 'dev' - defaulting to `dev`.\n3. Without any changes to `profiles.yml`, without setting any environment variables, and without needing to invoke a tap or target, they'd have their dbt environment configurable via the `config:` block in the `dbt-snowflake` plugin definition, inside `meltano.yml`.\n\n### Migration experience\n\n1. An existing Meltano user who already has the dbt plugin installed will perform a new install: `meltano install transformer dbt-snowflake`.\n2. This will keep their existing `meltano.yml` file as-is and will likewise not affect their existing profiles file.\n3. They will now have a new `dbt-snowflake` plugin and a new profiles file: `${MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT}\/transforms\/profiles\/snowflake\/profiles.yml`.\n4. The `dbt-snowflake` plugin will point to the _new_ profiles directory and the old `dbt` plugin will still point to the _old_ profiles directory.\n5. As a one time config, the user will set any necessary config in `meltano.yml` in order to properly seed dbt profile info with the `dbt-snowflake` settings config.\n6. Whenever the user is ready, they may optionally uninstall their older `dbt` plugin entry and delete the older `profiles.yml` file. (Side-by-side execution should work in the meanwhile.)\n\n## As related to #3098 and missing special environment variables:\n\nIf we do this right, it's very likely we can also solve #3098 at the same time as launching new adapter-specific dbt plugins.\n\n- All env variables currently injected by the `extractor` or `loader` will instead be declared as `settings` registered with `env:` mappings, with their values set via standard `config:` blocks.\n    - Aka: No \"magic\" environment variables are needed, all settings go through through plugin config.\n- Migrating to adapter-specific dbt entries comes along with new adapter-specific `profiles.yml` files.\n- The migration from generic `dbt` plugin to the adapter specific ones is a one-time breaking change which allows us to flush the tech debt without breaking existing installations using the legacy `dbt` plugin definition.\n\n### Messaging re `meltano run dbt:run`\n\nAfter releasing this, we'd recommend users to migrate to adapter-specific dbt plugins if they want to use `dbt:run` and other dbt-related invocations as part of `meltano run`. (Hence, a resolution to #3098.) This would be a one time and _voluntary_ breaking change, after which they'd (1) be on the latest version of dbt and (2) have a more resilient and robust `dbt` experience in Meltano overall.\n\n## Python updates under the hood\n\nInternally:\n\nAny logic internal to Meltano core which is hardcoded to the `dbt` plugin name would need to be replaced with logic that accepts plugins with the name `dbt*`.\n\n## Pointing to adapter-specific profiles folders\n\nImportant to note is that dbt only accepts overrides for the _directory_ containing `profiles.yml`, and does not allow you to point directly to a single file. For this reason I'm proposing the files bundles have `profiles.yml` files with paths in the format `${MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT}\/transform\/profiles\/<adapter>\/profiles.yml` and then `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` for `dbt-snowflake` (for instance) would default to the directory `${MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT}\/transform\/profiles\/snowflake`.\n\n## Accompanying `files` Bundles:\n\nThis should be reviewed and tested along with:\n\n- `files-dbt-biquery`: TODO\n- `files-dbt-postgres`: TODO\n- `files-dbt-redshift`: TODO\n- `files-dbt-snowflake`: https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/files-dbt-snowflake\/-\/merge_requests\/2\n\n## Usability: Invocation via `dbt:run` vs `dbt-snowflake:run`\n\nIf we install adapter-specific plugins as distinct `transformer` plugins, presumably this also makes their invocation slightly more verbose.\n\n- On the 'pros' side: this makes it very simple to support multiple dbt adapters in a single project, with no ambiguity. For instance: `dbt-snowflake:run` and `dbt-athena:run` would both \"just work\".\n- On the 'cons' side: invocation is more wordy, and any sample code like `meltano run dbt:run dbt:test` is no longer copy-paste-able to other projects.\n\n@kgpayne's suggestion in #3220+ could mitigate this. Ideally, if dev time were not a factor, we'd probably alias the first dbt installation as 'dbt' and then subsequent installations would _not_ be aliased.\n\n## Previous proposals:\n\n<details><summary>Click to expand<\/summary>\n\n### Option 1: Prompt during installation. (Replaced with 1B)\n\n<details><summary>Click to expand<\/summary>\n\n```console\n> meltano add transformer dbt\n\nPlease select from the following list:\n1. Redshift\n2. Snowflake\n3. Postgres\n4. BigQuery\n5. SQLite\n\nTo install more than one adapter, use commas as separators.\n\n> 5\n\nInstalling `dbt-sqlite`...\nInstall completed.\n```\n\n```console\n> meltano add transformer dbt --adapter=snowflake\nInstalling `dbt-snowflake`...\nInstall completed.\n```\n\n\n### Option 2: Read from meltano environment.\n\nIf we add the ability to specific a `primary_loader` to each environment, we can then check if the required adapter is installed in the `dbt` venv, installing it if not yet added. This could also be used to select or generate a proper profile from the target definition (more discussion about auto-managed profiles in #3104).\n\n<\/details>","state":"closed","created_at":1638830912028,"updated_at":1650432277887,"closed_at":1649955491928,"closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"},"labels":["OKR: Be the DataOps OS","Office Hours::Discussed","Roadmap","Transform","flow::Review","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351598,"iid":208,"group_id":2524164,"title":"April 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:06.797Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T14:53:27.097Z","due_date":"2022-04-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/groups\/meltano\/-\/milestones\/208"},"assignees":[{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"}],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80&d=identicon","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/uploads\/-\/system\/user\/avatar\/7646034\/avatar.png","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/kgpayne"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/meltano\/meltano\/-\/issues\/3105","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"_links":{"self":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3105","notes":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3105\/notes","award_emoji":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319\/issues\/3105\/award_emoji","project":"https:\/\/gitlab.com\/api\/v4\/projects\/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3105","relative":"#3105","full":"meltano\/meltano#3105"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":82.0,"epic":{"id":102873,"iid":82,"title":"Improved dbt integration","url":"\/groups\/meltano\/-\/epics\/82","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"<strong>Past due<\/strong>"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed"}]
