We are NOT deprecating support `elt` schedules in favor of `run`, and `meltano schedule` including `meltano schedule run` will support both.\n2. Airflow calls `meltano schedule run` [per schedule](https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-airflow/-/blob/master/bundle/orchestrate/dags/meltano.py#L99), it does NOT use `meltano elt` directly,  `meltano schedule run` uses MeltanoInvoker to spawn a `meltano elt` subprocess.\n   -

We can no longer reasonably scan all the plugins in the hub or in discovery.yml to identify matching namespaces and then have confidence that the matching plugins should be installed together. Instead, we need a more explicit mapping of files resources to the plugins that need those resources.\n\n## Proposed refactor:\n\n- The `namespace` field can be removed (optionally auto-calculated internally per #3374+).\n- Files resources are now defined inline with the plugins themselves.\n\n```yml\ntransformers:\n  - name: dbt\n    docs: https://docs.meltano.com/guide/transformation\n    repo: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core\n    pip_url: dbt-core~=1.0.0 dbt-postgres~=1.0.0 dbt-redshift~=1.0.0 dbt-snowflake~=1.0.0 dbt-bigquery~=1.0.0\n    bundle: # or `depends_on:`\n      files:\n      - name: files-dbt  # Name might be optional, since the plugin has a name in its API definition.\n        # This is the API endpoint\n        ref: https://hub.meltano.com/meltano/api/v1/plugins/extractors/tap-zendesk--twilio-labs\norchestrators:\n  - name: airflow\n    docs: https://docs.meltano.com/guide/orchestration\n    repo: https://github.com/apache/airflow\n    pip_url: 'apache-airflow==2.1.2 --constraint https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.1.2/constraints-${MELTANO__PYTHON_VERSION}.txt'\n    bundle:\n      files:\n      - name: airflow-files\n        variant: meltanolabs\n    settings:\n    # ...\n```\n\nThe files needed for the repo would then be self-contained within the plugin definition and are self-sufficient for installing the plugin, without needing external plugin to be installed.\n\n## Moving to `copier`\n\nOur current paradigm does not facilitate supporting changes over time to the files (the \"day 2\" problem). A related proposal would be to #3432+, but that can be delivered separately from this change.\n\n## Standalone `files` plugins\n\nWe can still support standalone `files` plugins for use cases where it still makes sense to do so apart from auto-installed resources for a `utility`, `transformer`, or `orchestrator` plugin.\n\nHowever, we would not post separate definitions to the hub for those `files` plugins which are best combined with their particular plugin.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-23T23:11:08.151Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T13:31:54.443Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T13:31:54.422Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Office Hours::Discussed","kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/209"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

I think that's relevant because it shows that the wildcard isn't overriding the inherited plugin configuration.\n\n### Further regression test\n_Ensure we automatically catch similar issues in the future_\n\n- [ ] Write additional adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-14T20:18:50.938Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T13:28:20.157Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T13:28:20.139Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["User Support","kind::Bug","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/209"},"assignees":[{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

Its easy to solve if I use the second method but if I define it using the --environment argument there doesnt seem to be any environment variable set. Is there a way to consistently do this?\n\nWe also now have default environments so the environment can be set in the meltano.yml too.\n\nFor any down stream process that wants to call meltano commands like I do in the dbt airflow dag generator https://gitlab.com/pnadolny13/files-airflow-dbt/-/blob/master/bundle/orchestrate/dags/generator_cache_builder.py#L36 it would be helpful to have the meltano environment exposed in the environment variables context. If I call `meltano --environment=prod invoke airflow webserver` then the dag generator should be able to access `MELTANO_ENVIRONMENT`.\n\nIt might be an anti pattern but it gives more flexibility to users so we can customize more.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-05T16:48:58.970Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T17:02:08.898Z","closed_at":"2022-04-21T17:02:08.803Z","closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken

Rather than compare `upstream/master` with `forkname/branchname`, the pipeline seems to be comparing `forkname/master` with `forkname/branchname`.\n\n```\n$ git fetch origin $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH; # collapsed multi-line command\nFrom https://gitlab.com/vischous/meltano\n * branch                master     -\u003e FETCH_HEAD\nComparing to master\n$ declare FILES=$(git diff --name-only

resolve this, we probably need to somehow explicitly compare with `upstream/master` or a similar reference, and to do so in a way that also works on the main `meltano` repo, which would not have an `upstream` reference.\n\nCc @edgarrmondragon,

where `latest*` and `v1.xx.0*` images are apparently being constantly updated on every build to `master`.\n\nProbably the solution is to have a more clear delineation between which images are \"dev/test\" images needed by later CI steps, and which images are \"published/stable\" images that can be relied upon by users with production workloads.\n\nNotes:\n\n- We can _optionally_ keep `latest` and `latest*` images linked to master CI builds, with the proper caveat/disclaimer to users that they are non-stable releases for the purposes of previewing unreleased features. (Not for production workloads.)\n- Versioned images `*v1.xx.0*` should definitely not be updated continually with new `master` updates.

I wanted to use `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve` which are not supported as `dbt:x` syntax because its not listed in the [discovery.yml](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/bundle/discovery.yml#L3073). This does not work:\n\n```\nmeltano invoke dbt:docs generate\n```\nSo I was thinking about adding an extra command to the plugin config like `docs_generate` that runs `docs generate` under the hood but then I realized that this works:\n\n```\nmeltano invoke dbt docs generate\n```\n\nI'm not sure this is a problem but with such a minor difference in syntax I could see it becoming confusing whether your running a meltano command or raw command directly to the package. On one hand its great to allow commands to pass through so all the functionality is preserved but on the other its not clear in what context the command is being run. Maybe just having a warning that a \"pass through\" command is being used would be helpful, idk but wanted to call it out.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-11T19:38:48.785Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T10:17:14.599Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T10:17:14.581Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351601,"iid":210,"group_id":2524164,"title":"June 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:39:02.417Z","due_date":"2022-06-30","start_date":"2022-06-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/210"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":8668050,"username":"pnadolny13","name":"Pat Nadolny","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8668050/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pnadolny13"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3242","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3242","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3242/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3242/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3242","relative":"#3242","full":"meltano/meltano#3242"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":123,"epic":{"id":338495,"iid":123,"title":"Improve CLI User Experience","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/123","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":102287699,"iid":3239,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Meltano UI tracking consent \"learn more\" link not found","description":"The link to \"learn more\" in our tracking consent popup actually references a link that no longer exists.

Leave any entry blank to skip, \nor enter a new value. Password values will automatically be hidden \nfrom display for any settings of type 'password'.\n\nPress Ctrl+C to cancel at any time.\n\nSetting #1: project_dir\nDescription: The root dbt path.\nType: string\nDefault value: $MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT/transform\nCurrent value: (none)\nNew Value: _ \n\n(skipped)\n\n....\n\nSetting #7: snowflake_user\nDescription: The username to use in Snowflake authentication.\nType: string\nDefault value: (none)\nCurrent value: (none)\nNew Value: snowflake_prod_user\n\nValue saved successfully to meltano.yml!\n\nSetting #8: snowflake_password\nDescription: The password to use in Snowflake authentication.\nType: password\nDefault value: $MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT/transform\nCurrent value: (none)\nNew Value: ********** \n\nValue saved successfully to Meltano System DB!\n\n```\n\n## Spec Details\n\n- Interactive behavior is triggered bia the `--interactive` flag in `meltano config ... set`.\n- Interactive behavior can be triggered for a single setting or with `--all` to set all settings associated with the given plugin.\n- The `--all` option _requires_ the `--interactive` flag. If `--all` is specified without `--interactive`, Meltano should fail.\n- After each setting is set, Meltano should respond with `Value saved successfully to _\u003cstore\u003e_!`\n  - The store could be `.env`, the SystemDB, or to Meltano.yml.\n  - Confirming and saving after each setting is set gives real-time feedback to the user about changes they have applied, and allows the remaining operation to be canceled without loss of any setting values already saved.\n- Individual settings should be skippable.\n- Password fields should either print asterisks or simply not echo anything while users are typing.\n- The new setting value should not be provided inline at the command line if `--interactive` is set. So, passing the setting value and also passing `--interactive` should cause Meltano to fail.\n\n## Ability to \"skip\" settings\n\nSkipping a setting may not be intuitive if done inline with the setting value input.\n\n```\nSetting #1: project_dir\nDescription: The root dbt path.\nType: string\nDefault value: $MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT/transform\nCurrent value: (none)\nWould you like to set a new value? [Y/n]: n\n\nSkipped.\n\nSetting #2: snowflake_user\nDescription: The username to use in Snowflake authentication.\nType: string\nDefault value: (none)\nCurrent value: (none)\nWould you like to set a new value? [Y/n]: Y\nNew Value? []: snowflake_prod_user\n\nValue saved successfully to meltano.yml!\n\n...\n```\n\nWithout a separate prompt to skip or set the value, the user would generally have to type something like an empty string or `s` for skip, or similar. However, those are potentially valid answers to the new value prompt.\n\n## Phases\n\n- The initial merge should at minimum provide `--all --interactive` support.\n- Optionally, setting only one value (`--interactive` without `--all`) can be included in initial scope or added in a subsequent iteration.\n  - When setting only a single value, presumably we do not need to allow the \"skip\" option described above, since the user can simply abort (`ctrl+c`) to cancel if they do not want the value set.\n- Not required in this first iteration, but a future iteration should require users to first define a setting's type if the type is not yet set. Would be a path for resolving #2768+. For example, if the user runs `meltano config tap-snowflake set --interactive snowflake_password`, that should require the user to _first_ define the setting `kind` (kind is `password` in this case), which then drives correct parsing and storage of the provided value.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-09T21:01:33.149Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T10:15:26.269Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T10:15:26.247Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty

If you've reached this template in error, please select another template from the list.)\n\n## Evergreen Releases - Prep Steps:\n\nAn `Evergreen` release process means we are _always_ releasing. We open a new release ticket as soon as we've completed the prior release. (It's therefore the final step in this checklist.)\n\n## \"Evergreen Prep\" Checklist\n\n- [x] Open this Issue\n- [x] Indicate the version to be released here in the issue's title `Release vX.Y.Z`\n    - If the release number changes (from minor to major or patch, for instance), update the version here and in the issue description.\n\n### Readiness Checklist:\n\n`Engineering` team, to get ready for the upcoming release:\n\n1. [x] Ensure any [already-merged commits](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/commits/master) since the last release have [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) entries (excepting non-user-impacting commits, such as docs fixes).\n2. [x] Create a comment in the `#engineering-team` slack channel with pending-but-not-merged MRs, potentially shipping. (Aka, the \"burndown\" list.)\n    - Otherwise a comment that all known merge candidates are already merged.\n3. [x] Create or link to a summary of MRs merged and/or expected in the `#marketing` Slack channel, with an `@channel` mention.\n\n### Release Checklist\n\nRotating `assignee`, on the morning of the release:\n\n1. [x] Changelog updates and version bump:\n    1. [x] Check the [pending MRs](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/merge_requests?sort=updated_desc) to make sure nothing expected is still waiting to be merged.\n    2. [x] Create a [new branch](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/branches/new) named `release/vX.Y.Z` and a corresponding MR with the `Release` MR template.\n    3. An automated pipeline (linked to the branch prefix `release/v*`) will\n    immediately and automatically bump the version and flush the changelog.\n        - [x] Check this box to confirm the automated changelog flush and version bump are correct.\n        - You _do not_ need to wait for the CI pipeline. (An identical CI pipeline is already included in the below.)\n2. [x] [Cut a release tag](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/tags/new) from your `release/vX.Y.Z` branch _(not from `main`)_ named `vX.Y.Z` with Message=`Release vX.Y.Z`\n    1. In response to new tag creation, these steps are performed automatically in Gitlab pipelines:\n        1. Abort if tag `vX.Y.Z` does not match output from `poetry version --short`\n        2. Test _everything_.\n        3. Publish to PyPi \u003c!-- Meltano-only: and Docker --\u003e.\n    2. Validate publish once the pipeline finishes. (While the process is running, you can continue with next steps, such as changelog grooming.)\n        1. [x] Check this box when the tag's [pipeline](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/pipelines) has completed (eta 40-60 minutes).\n        2. [x] Check this box when [PyPi publish](https://pypi.org/project/meltano/#history) is confirmed.\n        \u003c!-- Meltano-only: 5. [ ] Check this box when [Docker publish]() is confirmed. --\u003e\n3. Groom the changelog:\n    1. [x] Compare the [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) against the `main` branch [commit history](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/commits/master) and add any significant user-impacting updates (excluding docs and website updates, for instance).\n    3. [x] Review the Changelog for readability and typoes, committing fixes or updates if needed.\n    2. [ ] Final changelog review:\n        - Open the Changelog in preview mode, mouse over each link and ensure tooltip descriptions match the resolved issue.\n        - Check contributor profile links to make sure they are correct.\n    3. [x] Merge the resulting MR to `main` with the merge commit message `Release vX.Y.Z`\n    4. [x] [Open the next `Release` issue](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/new?issue) using the `Release` template.\n\n### Announcements, Marketing, and Promotion\n\n`Marketing` or `Product` team:\n\n1. [ ] Post-release announcement steps:\n    1. [x] Post announcement to Meltano slack: `#announcements`\n    \u003c!-- SDK only: 2. [ ] Cross-post (share) to `#sdk` --\u003e\n    3. Copy-paste to:\n       - [x] `Singer` slack: `#meltano` \u003c!-- SDK only: `#singer-sdk` --\u003e\n       - [x] `dbt` slack: `#tools-meltano`\n    4. [ ] Blog post\n    5. [ ] Tweet the blog post\n\n----------------","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-04T18:38:30.274Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T19:18:36.090Z","closed_at":"2022-02-15T19:17:00.002Z","closed_by":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

The Meltano runtime or the plugin runtime? 🤯 \n- Defining env var maps to predictable names via the `env_aliases` [key](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/schema/discovery.schema.json#L661) for reuse across types of plugins (now marked as deprecated 🤦‍♂️). (e.g. `TAP_POSTGRESS_HOST` \u003e `PG_ADDRESS`).\n- Defining settings aliases via the `aliases` [key](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/schema/discovery.schema.json#L581) as alternative names by which the setting can be configured in `meltano.yml` and the CLI. This is often done to 'prettify' or make uniform with other plugin variants (e.g. `postgres_host` \u003e `host`). **Note:* Meltano does not currently look for env vars of the form `\u003cplugin name\u003e_\u003calias name\u003e` by default (though sunch env vars can be specified as `env_aliases` manually), nor does it appear to check or warn of clashes as the result of settings referenced in multiple ways (by its `name`, `aliases` or `env_aliases`).\n\nIn addition to the behaviours implemented as part of discovery, Meltano has 2 other builtin mechanisms for handling/discovering settings:\n\n- [Pipeline environment variables](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#pipeline-environment-variables) define settings that are passed from the environment of one plugin to the next in a pipeline (e.g. `extractor\u003eloader\u003etransformer`).\n- [Plugin extras](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/configuration#plugin-extras) define settings used to configure the behaviour of specific plugin types _before_ and _after_ 3rd party code is invoked. This works by passing `plugin_extra` settings for use by all subclasses of [`BasePlugin`](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/base.py#L246) (e.g. extras available to the [`SingerTap`](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/singer/tap.py#L104) allow users to [override](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/singer/tap.py#L302) the `catalog.json` path used during Tap invocation).\n\n### Configuration\n\nConfiguration is how end-users populate discovered settings with their own values. Config is done by:\n\n- Using the `meltano config ...` CLI and `meltano.yml` to configure the above settings by name.\n- Using environment variables in the Meltano runtime to configure the above settings via a `\u003cPLUGIN NAME\u003e_\u003cSETTING_NAME\u003e` env var naming convention. Environment variables can either be `export`'d into the Meltano runtime or coded in a `.env` file automatically discovered by Meltano.\n-  Using values stored in the Meltano [system database](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/project#system-database) to configure settings by name (also available through the UI).\n-  Using the `env:` key of the [environments](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/environments) feature to inject arbitrary environment variables into a plugins environment. These env vars will also be passed to subsequent stages in a pipeline according to the [pipeline environment variables](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#pipeline-environment-variables) feature.\n\t- How are duplicates/clashes handled?\n-  Setting env vars in the Meltano runtime environment matching names specified in setting `env:` and `env_aliases:` discovery keys (that do not have to conform to the `\u003cPLUGIN NAME\u003e_\u003cSETTING_NAME\u003e` conventions) to inject values into the plugins environment. **Note:** this is now an undesired behaviour, as per [#2984](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2984).\n-  Referencing provided [pipeline environment variables](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#pipeline-environment-variables) in plugin tools code (e.g. the [provided profiles.yml](https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-dbt/-/blob/master/bundle/transform/profile/profiles.yml))\n-  Using `plugin_extras` to configure the pre and post invocation behaviours of plugins.\n-  Mapping a setting to an environment variable by adding a `my_setting: ${MY_ENV_VAR}` mapping under the `config:` block in `meltano.yml` or via the CLI using `meltano config \u003cplugin\u003e set my_setting \"${MY_ENV_VAR}\"`.\n\t- Which environment is `MY_ENV_VAR` expected to be in? The Meltano runtime or the plugin runtime? 🤯 \n\n## FAQ's\n\n- What is the difference between `config` and `settings`?\n\n\tSettings are specified as part of plugin definitions for the purposes of discovery. Config is the mechanism by which the fields described as settings are populated with values.\n\n\tWhilst `settings` usually only appear in `discovery.yml`, custom plugins added in `meltano.yml` places `settings` and `config` in the same view, which is completely baffling.\n\n- How does `config` specified in `meltano.yml` arrive in files inside a plugins runtime? e.g. Singers' `config.json` or dbts' `profiles.yml`?\n\n\tFor Singer the `SingerPlugin` class `src/meltano/core/plugin/singer/base.py` has a method (decorated as a `before_configure` Hook) for [writing a valid config.json file]() and another for [removing the file after](). Config arrives via an instance of the `PluginSettingsService` instantiated with both project and plugin.\n\t\n\tFor dbt (specifically `profiles.yml` the approach is slightly different. dbt supports the retrieval of env vars within its config files (using jinja templating syntax). Therefore we need only match the env vars specified in the [provided profiles.yml](https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-dbt/-/blob/master/bundle/transform/profile/profiles.yml) to those available inside the Transformers environment. To smooth over this injection of env vars, Meltano makes available all the env vars provided to the Loader available to the Transformer as well, as part of the [pipeline environment feature](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#pipeline-environment-variables). Currently we prescribe env vars of the form `PG_*` in the file bundle, but any matching env var name could be used (e.g. `TARGET_POSTGRES_*` to match the Loader env var convention).\n\n- How do we determine what `settings`, specified in discovery, should be environment variables vs. which should be injected into files?\n\n\tThis is implemented using the `env:` and `env_aliases:` keys in `discovery.yml`. Details as per Douwes comment [here]:\n\t\n\t\u003e The behaviour around `env` and `env_aliases` is implemented in [`SettingsService.setting_env_vars`](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/plugin/settings_service.py#L63), which takes a `for_writing` boolean (which is `False` by default). Writing here means writing into the plugin's execution env, not-writing means reading from Meltano's execution env to populate a setting (that may then be written into the plugin execution env later). That `for_writing` flag is passed to [`SettingDefinition.env_vars`](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/blob/master/src/meltano/core/setting_definition.py#L174) as `include_custom`. Following the logic there shows that when reading from the env, only the auto generated `\u003cprefix\u003e_\u003cname\u003e` is checked, and when writing into the env, env and env_aliases are used as well. I think the logic is that we want Meltano users to always use `\u003cprefix\u003e_\u003cname\u003e` consistently, but the plugin itself may expect a different env var.\n\t\n\tThis description does not appear to explain the case described by [#2984](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2984), which sparked our efforts to deprecate `env:` and `env_aliases:` in the first place 🤷‍♂️\n\n## Proposed Next Steps\n\n- To resolve  [#2984](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2984) I believe we should remove the ability of the `SettingsService` to retrieve for injection any env vars _other than_ those matching the `\u003cplugin name\u003e_\u003csetting name\u003e` convention from the Meltano runtime environment. This meets Douwes intent that:\n\n\t\u003e we want Meltano users to always use `\u003cprefix\u003e_\u003cname\u003e` consistently, but the plugin itself may expect a different env var.\"\n\n- Implement a check to determine if any arbitrary env vars configured in `environments.[].env` do not clash with `env:` and `env_aliases:` defined in discovery. Warn or error if clashes are found.\n\n- Provide guidance/docs on the usage on `env:` and `env_aliases:` keys in discovery. AJ suggests:\n\t\n\t\u003e General plugins vs Singer plugins: General plugins must get some of there config from env vars; Singer plugins should not need env vars - but some do. Following from this:\n\n\t\u003e - It's a healthy pattern for General plugins to declare `env:` entries to pass along settings to the plugin context (but probably not `env_aliases:`).\n\t\u003e - It's a discouraged pattern for Singer plugins to declare `env:` entries. (We'll support if needed, but we should keep an eye on them and this should be the exception rather than the rule.)\n\t\u003e - To avoid confusion around which env entries are needed for Singer plugins to function - versus which are convenient aliases, I think we should remove `env_alias:` entries from Singer plugins, replacing them with env: entries and an explanatory comment with issue link perhaps.\n\n### Description V1\n\nQuick summary of recent findings:\n\n1. `env_aliases` / `env` - These are the same functionally. (New info to everyone!) - these fit the description as recently added in the JSON Schema for `env:`:\n    - \u003e `An environment variable that will be initialized with the setting's value whenever the plugin is invoked. This is used to inject environment variables into the plugin's execution context. If the named environment variable is already defined at runtime, Meltano will use the passed value from context instead of the configured value.`\n    - Essentially a two-way read and write to/from the env variable.\n2. The `env_alias` and `env` entries also have a special role in seeding `dbt_profiles.yml`. Specifically `PG_ADDRESS`, etc. I think (to confirm?) this is part of the reason dbt cannot be run on its own: because if the target wasn't invoked, those settings don't exist.\n3. Settings aliases - newly discovered! Similar to `env_aliases` but at the setting level.\n    - To be confirmed: if these are compatible with env injection in the form `\u003cPLUGIN_NAME\u003e_\u003cSETTING_ALIAS\u003e`. More in #3209.\n4. `config` vs `settings`: `settings` are the plugin definition (optionally with default values) and `config` is one project's settings values.\n5. When a user wants to map a setting to an environment variable, the recommended way of doing so is probably to add a `my_setting: ${MY_ENV_VAR}` mapping under the `config:` block.\n6. General plugins vs Singer plugins: General plugins _must_ get some of there config from env vars; Singer plugins should not need env vars - but some do. Following from this:\n    - It's a healthy pattern for General plugins to declare `env:` entries to pass along settings to the plugin context (but probably not `env_aliases:`).\n    - It's a discouraged pattern for Singer plugins to declare `env:` entries. (We'll support if needed, but we should keep an eye on them and this should be the exception rather than the rule.)\n    - To avoid confusion around which env entries are needed for Singer plugins to function - versus which are convenient aliases, I think we should remove `env_alias:` entries from Singer plugins, replacing them with `env:` entries and an explanatory comment with issue link perhaps.\n\n------------------------\n\nAs per office hours 2022/02/02, the current mechanism of declaring an environment variable to be populated within plugin `settings` using `env:` and `env_alias:` causes confusion to even experienced Meltano users.\n\nFrom the jsonschema:\n\n```json\n\"env\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\",\n    \"description\": \"An environment variable that will be initialized with the setting's value whenever the plugin is invoked. This is used to inject environment variables into the plugin's execution context. If the named environment variable is already defined at runtime, Meltano will use the passed value from context instead of the configured value.\",\n    \"examples\": [\n        \"DBT_PROFILES_DIR\",\n        \"GE_HOME\"\n    ]\n}\n\n\"env_aliases\": {\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"description\": \"Deprecated. Use to delegate alternative environment variables for overriding this setting's value\",\n    \"examples\": [\n        \"TAP_ACCOUNT_ID\",\n        \"TAP_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER\"\n    ],\n    \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSpecifically, from `env`,:\n\n\u003e If the named environment variable is already defined at runtime, Meltano will use the passed value from context instead of the configured value.\n\nThis causes unexpected behaviours for users not aware of this dual behaviour. We propose that, in stead of relying on `env:` for both purposes (sourcing values to inject _and_ determining the target env var name to inject into), we simply remove the sourcing behaviour. This would mean Meltano would no longer search its runtime environment for matching env var names to retrieve values, effectively making any settings with `env:` specified an \"environment variable type setting\" (as suggested by @tayloramurphy [here](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/merge_requests/2505#note_829519083)). Sourcing of values would only be possible via the standard mechanisms; explicit `config:` or env vars in the Meltano runtime of the form `\u003cplugin name\u003e_\u003csetting name\u003e`.\n\n`env_aliases` might be kept to allow one setting to be mapped to multiple env vars. E.g.\n\n```yaml\nsettings:\n- name: aws_profile\n  env: AWS_PROFILE\n  env_aliases: [AWS_DEFUALT_PROFILE]\n```\n\nor both could be replaced with an array-type `env_vars:` e.g.:\n\n```yaml\nsettings:\n- name: aws_profile\n  env_vars: [AWS_PROFILE, AWS_DEFUALT_PROFILE]\n```\n\nIt is also worth considering if these settings should be injected as keys in config files either. Not doing so would further increase the specificity of the settings function as \"an environment variable created from a Meltano setting\".\n\n### Possible Challenges\n\n- Users can also set environment variables directly using the `env:` key in the `--environment` feature. This produces two ways to achieve the same outcome, and may cause conflicts and confusion to users. This can be handled with a resolution order (preferring settings above environment variables) and/or by warning/erroring if the same env var is specified by the two methods.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-03T12:04:44.695Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T21:13:11.414Z","closed_at":"2022-04-29T21:13:11.395Z","closed_by":{"id":1942272,"username":"tayloramurphy","name":"Taylor

LicenseFinder and the wrapper (called `license_management`) provided by GitLab i) do not support poetry natively and ii) only detect 2/3rds of our total licenses. A brief evaluation of `pip-licenses` detected all but 1 of our dependencies licenses, and supports poetry (by virtue of running within a python virtualenv).

This can be done by contributing a new report class to `pip-licenses` for optionally outputting the required GitLab artefact.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-02-01T15:42:13.643Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T10:11:55.712Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T10:11:55.694Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["kind::Risk","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":797629,"iid":42,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Backlog","description":"As a start, I think it would be good to prioritize based on:\r\n- urgency of getting feedback\r\n- relative implementation difficulty\r\n- symbiotic relationships between issues","state":"active","created_at":"2019-02-21T14:50:28.741Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T14:50:28.741Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2019-02-25","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/42"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3198","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3198","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3198/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3198/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3198","relative":"#3198","full":"meltano/meltano#3198"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101487305,"iid":3190,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Meltano Test bug with files bundles","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"regression\" or \"bug\" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n\nIf you are submitting an issue with a tap, please include:\n\n- account details\n- target details\n- entities selected  with meltano select (if you have selected any entities), as the bug may be related to a specific entity\n- the full elt command you are running\n- full output of the meltano elt command.

File bundle 'dbt' does not define any commands.`. It looks like its iterating my plugins by name and getting to my file bundle named `dbt` before it gets to my transformer named `dbt`. If I remove the files bundle, my tests work. If I rename my files bundle I get errors.\n\n```\n  transformers:\n  - name: dbt\n    pip_url: git+https://github.com/Tomme/dbt-athena.git@c8e0458f85aaa8f9b693f99903ba95c41b90573b\n    config:\n      target: athena\n    commands:\n      test_publish_hub: test --models marts.publish.meltano_hub.*\n  files:\n  - name: dbt\n    pip_url: git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-dbt.git@config-version-2\n```\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n_What should be happening?_\n\nThe test feature shouldnt consider tests in the files plugin section. Maybe larger than that it might need to accept a plugin.plugin_name combo (i.e. meltano test transformer.dbt:test_123) if a project has multiple plugins with the same name.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n_How one can reproduce the issue?_\n\nInstall dbt then add a command starting with the test prefix and run `meltano test dbt:test_name`.\n\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n_Please use code blocks (\\`\\`\\`) to format console output_\n\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n_If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem or suggest a fix_\n\n\n\n### Further regression test\n_Ensure we automatically catch similar issues in the future_\n\n- [ ] Write additional adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-28T19:28:42.416Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T16:52:52.461Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T11:36:01.718Z","closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"labels":["flow::Review","kind::Bug","urgency::high","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2286177,"iid":204,"group_id":2524164,"title":"February 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:21:35.408Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T20:28:25.106Z","due_date":"2022-02-28","start_date":"2022-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/204"},"assignees":[{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"}],"author":{"id":8668050,"username":"pnadolny13","name":"Pat Nadolny","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8668050/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pnadolny13"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3190","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":2,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3190","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3190/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3190/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3190","relative":"#3190","full":"meltano/meltano#3190"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":82,"epic":{"id":102873,"iid":82,"title":"Improved dbt integration","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/82","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":101474780,"iid":3189,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Improve documentation around what a namespace is and does","description":"Reading through the documentation, we don't do a good job of explaining what `namespace` does or means.

For sensitive credentials I set them in the .env while non-sensitive environment specific settings (like schema_name) get set at the meltano.yml environment level.\n\nThe functionality I want is to be able to combine both sensitive and non-sensitive variables for use in a plugin as an environment variable. A use case is in the squared repo where we have an Athena connection string used in Great Expectations and Superset:\n\n`awsathena+rest://[YOUR_AWS_KEY]:[YOUR_AWS_SECRET]@athena.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/[YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME]?s3_staging_dir=s3://[YOUR_S3_PATH]`\n\nI want to be able to set the secret keys in my .env and the path and schema in my meltano.yml environment. Right now templating is supported in meltano.yml for config values using environment variables but for some plugins, especially utilities, configs arent useful and we need to be building environment variables that the utility can access. Templating doesnt seem to be supported at the `env` level underneath the `environment` key. So right now I can set secrets in the .env and non-sensitive variables at the `environment.env` level in meltano.yml but I have no way of blending the two to pass along to a plugin, so I end up building the connection string multiple times in the plugins vs defining it once.\n\nIdeas: Add an `env` key to plugin configs that allows you to use templating to build a new environment variable at the plugin/environment level. Or...allow templating at the current `env` key level based on whats in your .env file.\n\n## Update (2022-05-05)\n\nScope of this issue is now to:\n\n* Write tests based on the spec in the [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO3j_ADw=/)\n* Fix anything that fails tests\n* Update documentation to clarify inheritance\n\n## Update (2022-05-03)\n\n**Relevant [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO3j_ADw=/) where we're whiteboarding all of this**\n\n## Spec Update (2022-04-08)\n\nNote: this updated spec follows from my comment here: https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3173#note_817409586\n\n### Problem statement:\n\nCurrently, env variables at different levels of the code cannot necessarily rely on each other or build upon each other.\n\n### Proposed solution:\n\nWe would define environment variable inheritance to be valid across these layers, in this strict order:\n\n- Level 1: terminal context (inherited either via `.env` or via shell env vars)\n- Level 2: top-level `env:` declarations within `meltano.yml`\n- Level 3: environment-level `env:` declarations.\n- Level 4: `env:` declarations within top-level plugin definitions.\n- Level 5: `env:` declarations within environment-scoped plugin definitions.\n\n### Example\n\nThis shows how inheritance would be expected to function across the 5 named levels. (Could be a unit test during development.)\n\n`.env`\n\n```sh\n# Level 1: terminal context\n# Inherits from none\nLEVEL_NUM=\"1\"\nSTACKED=\"1\"\n```\n\n```yml\nenv:\n  # Level 2: top-level `env:`\n  # Inherits from terminal context\n  LEVEL_NUM: \"2\"                  #  '2'\n  STACKED: \"${STACKED}2\"          # '12'\nplugins:\n  extractors:\n    tap-foobar:\n      env:\n        # Level 4: plugin-level `env:`\n        # Inherits from a environment-level `env:` if an environment is active\n        # Inherits directly from top-level `env:` if no environment is active\n        LEVEL_NUM: \"4\"            #    '4'\n        STACKED: \"${STACKED}4\"    # '1234'\nenvironments:\n  prod:\n    env:\n      # Level 3: environment-level `env:`\n      # Inherits from top-level `env:`\n      LEVEL_NUM: \"3\"              #   '3'\n      STACKED: \"${STACKED}3\"      # '123'\n  plugins:\n    extractors:\n      tap-foobar:\n        env:\n          # Level 5: environment-level plugin `env:`\n          # Inherits from (global) plugin-level `env:`\n          LEVEL_NUM: \"5\"          #     '5'\n          STACKED: \"${STACKED}5\"  # '12345'\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q. Why does the global plugin level config (level 4) inherit from the environment-level config?**\n\nA: This is counterintuitive at first but actually quite necessary.\n\nImagining that the plugin settings globally include a call to `$SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME` and imagine that each environment has its own value for `SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME: ___` in the respective `env:`. We don't want each environment to have to redundantly declare the plugin properties but we _do_ want to use the `$SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME` value that is most appropriate from the given execution context. Hence, the global-level plugin can be defined once to leverage whatever value is in `$SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME` and the plugin's configuration will still be seeded properly according to which environment is active.\n\n## Providing level info for research/debugging\n\nPerhaps in the `dry-run` proposal in #3146, it would be good to print where each environment variables are sourced. We will need to do this without exposing sensitive values.\n\nSo, if the example above were real, we might get debug info such as:\n\n```\nmeltano run --dry tap-foobar target-snowflake\nPrinting debug info in response to `--dry` CLI argument. No actions will be executed.\n\nThe plugin `tap-foobar` was declared with the following context:\n\n- env:LEVEL_NUM - derived from the following, in order of precedence:\n    - environments[prod].plugins[tap-foobar].env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - plugins[tap-foobar].env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - environments[prod].env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - env[LEVEL_NUM]\n    - shell.env[LEVEL_NUM]\n...\n```\n\nOr perhaps a more realistic example:\n\n```\nmeltano run --dry tap-foobar target-snowflake\nPrinting debug info in response to `--dry` CLI argument. No actions will be executed.\n\nThe plugin `tap-foobar` was declared with the following context:\n\n- 'tap-foobar.config[username]' was derived from the following, in order of precedence:\n    - environments[prod].env[FOOBAR_USERNAME]\n    - env[FOOBAR_USERNAME]\n...\n```\n\nIn the above example, the 'prod' declaration of `FOOBAR_USERNAME` clobbers the global one. The user can infer from this printout that their `prod`-level config is working correctly, and if they were to remove the prod-level config, they'd get the value of the top-level `env:` declaration.\n\n## Related Topics\n\nMore discussion on this can and probably should be moved to a follow on issue, but for completeness:\n\n### Further detail and settings-level `env:` declarations (`level 6`)\n\nNot listed above, but a plugin setting may have `env:` declared, which operates differently from the other layers. This `plugin.settings[].env:` declaration simply accepts a string as env variable name, and the specified setting value will get injected and sent _into_ the plugin's subprocess. \n\n- This functionality is required in order to have plugins behave as expected. Non-singer plugins don't receive a `config.json` so the env variable injection is the substitute.\n- I think the `env:` function at the setting layer should _always_ be a pure child process injection (clobbering any existing env var but not reading from it).\n- We should probably stop this layer 6 from _also_ sourcing data from layers 1-5, and instead make it a pure one-way injection into the plugin context. As described in #3447+\n- I do not know if the current status quo for an existing `env` variable value will clobber an explicitly defined config value, or if the config value would clobber the env variable value, essentially replacing the env var value within the plugin's child process.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-20T19:40:37.477Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T10:08:47.482Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T10:08:47.462Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Office Hours::Discussed","flow::Triage","kind::Feature","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/209"},"assignees":[{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4025463/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cjohnhanson"}],"author":{"id":8668050,"username":"pnadolny13","name":"Pat Nadolny","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/8668050/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/pnadolny13"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4025463,"username":"cjohnhanson","name":"Cody Hanson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4025463/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cjohnhanson"},"user_notes_count":27,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3173","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3173","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3173/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3173/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3173","relative":"#3173","full":"meltano/meltano#3173"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":136,"epic":{"id":421018,"iid":136,"title":"Meltano 2.0 Release","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/136","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 29, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":{"id":56416,"iid":56,"sequence":3,"group_id":2524164,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-05-13T20:04:48.839Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T00:05:02.370Z","start_date":"2022-05-23","due_date":"2022-05-29","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/iterations/56416"},"health_status":null},{"id":100981585,"iid":3172,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Legacy python 3.6 compatibility code","description":"With the dropping of python 3.6 support in #2991, I also had a very quick search through the codebase to find comments that referenced 3.6 compatibility hacks:\n\n```\n(melty-3.8) ➜  meltano git:(2991-python-3-6-eol) ✗ grep \"3\\.6\" * -r | egrep -v \"\\.js|.vue|.lock|\\.svg|.node_modules|\\.log|Binary file|CHANGELOG\"\nsrc/meltano/core/plugin_install_service.py:        #

transforms\"","description":"In preparation for #2299 (and/or the similar #2300), we should discuss what to call these things. We especially should consider how the naming decisions will impact (1) the new user experience and (2) possibly overlap or confusion regarding other existing plugins and interactions.\n\n## Background Context\n\n### History of \"Stream Maps\" naming within the SDK\n\nWhen developing the Stream Maps feature in the SDK, one very important paradigm which allowed that effort to move forward was the concept of the \"Map\" process of a \"Map-Reduce\" paradigm. While the word \"tranformation\" can mean anything in the set of operations {Map/Reduce/Lookup/Filter/etc.}, we are limited in an inline capacity to basically these two: Map and Filter. (Lookups are possible in an inline capacity but they are very different than lookups which occur in SQL, and as such they are extremely expensive and require a robust caching strategy that is far beyond our scope.)\n\nSo, \"Stream Maps\" naming or \"Map Transforms\" naming was intended to highlight the focus on operations which can be performed scalably in an _inline_ capacity. **Unlike \"true\" transform tools like dbt, we do not have all of the data available before we execute; we have only one record at a time and we must be able to treat each record in isolation before passing it downstream (or not).**\n\nLegacy ETL tools tried to do any and all type of \"big T\" transform functions `{Map/Reduce/Lookup/Filter/etc.}` before passing data downstream to the target, which although more rare now is still a problem in the industry using existing tools like Informatica, SSIS, Alteryx, Azure Data Factory, etc. This \"traditional/legacy ETL\" approach is an anti-pattern for very good reason and we should be very clear we are _not_ supporting it.\n\n### Why not just call them \"transformations\" or \"transforms\"\n\nIf applying a little \"m\" for a lightweight inline map transform, `ELT` becomes `EmLT`. Note the little `m` and the big `T` are entirely different capabilities, with different performance constraints and resource availability. We _do not_ want to confuse users by saying this is okay: `ETLT` - this would be a huge step backwards in terms of DataOps best practices, and would cause detrimental confusion to end users if they think there's no difference between \"transform\" in the middle of EL and the \"transform\" in the SQL/dbt layer.\n\nWhen we speak of these conversationally, we use the word \"transformations\" often. However, the name collision with dbt (the *true* \"T\" in \"ELT\" pipeline, is extremely problematic - the `m` and `T` perform very different functions, with different physics constraints, latency expectations, and host server hardware profiles. They also have very different risk profiles for data loss in case of code errors or other unexpected failure.\n\n## Option A: `mappers` are a new plugin type, with associated `mappings` entries in `meltano.yml`\n\nSimilar to as written up in #2299:\n\n```shell\nmeltano add mapper meltano-map-transform\nmeltano add mapper pipelinewise-transform-field\n```\n\n```yml\n# meltano.yml\nmappers:\n- name: meltano-map-transform\n  pip_url: meltano-map-transform\n  config:                         # Optionally, a default config.\n    # ...\n- name: pipelinewise-transform-field\n  pip_url: pipelinewise-transform-field\nextractors:\n- name: tap-gitlab\n  # ...\n  mappings:\n  - name: pii-hasher               # The name of the map transform to apply.\n    mapper: meltano-map-transform  # The mapper plugin to use.\n    config:                        # What will be sent to the transformer in a config.json file.\n      stream_maps:\n        customers:\n          id_hashed: md5(record['id'])\n          id: None\n```\n\nOption B: Transformers are of a `type`: `streaming` or `build`\n\nAnother (admittedly less preferred) option would be to allow `mappers` into the family of `transformer` utilities but with the addition of a new `type` attribute which specifically distinguishes them from other transformation types.\n\nThe `dbt` transformer would be something to indicate it has all data landed in the target upfront, such as `build` or `post-load`.\n\nThe `mapper` transformers would have some `type` value indicating their place as map-transforms and not full fledge data build/transform/aggregation tools. Possible values for `type` could be: `streaming`, `inline`, `mapper`, or `stream_map`.\n\ncc @tayloramurphy, @edgarrmondragon, @pandemicsyn, @kgpayne","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-15T21:27:47.594Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T23:07:53.973Z","closed_at":"2021-12-16T22:44:15.398Z","closed_by":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"labels":["Discussion","Plugin Management","flow::Review","kind::Non-Product"],"milestone":{"id":2286172,"iid":200,"group_id":2524164,"title":"Fri: Dec 17, 2021","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:20:21.743Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T16:10:50.410Z","due_date":"2021-12-17","start_date":"2021-12-11","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/200"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3123","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3123","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3123/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3123/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3123","relative":"#3123","full":"meltano/meltano#3123"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":116,"epic":{"id":331276,"iid":116,"title":"Enable ELT pipelines in Meltano to be composable","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/116","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 30, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":99104978,"iid":3122,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Add a default Environment when `meltano init` is invoked","description":"### Problem to solve\n\nIncrease awareness and use of the [`Environments` feature](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2869) by including a default `environments: ...` entry in `meltano.yml` for new projects.\n\n### Target audience\n\nUsers starting fresh new Meltano projects.\n\n### Further details\n(Include use cases, benefits, and/or goals)\n\n- New projects get the benefits of having at least one declared environment in `meltano.yml`.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAn initial set of environments that might be sensible is:\n\n```yaml\nenvironments:\n- name: dev\n  config:\n    plugins: {}\n  env: {}\n- name: prod\n  config:\n    plugins: {}\n  env: {}\n```\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\n\nWe should see an increased use of `environments` for new projects.\n\n### Regression test\n(Ensure the feature doesn't cause any regressions)\n- [ ] Write adequate test cases and submit test results\n- [ ] Test results should be reviewed by a person from the team\n\n### Links / references","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-15T18:28:30.924Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T18:14:52.803Z","closed_at":"2022-02-16T13:44:21.808Z","closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"labels":["flow::Review","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2286177,"iid":204,"group_id":2524164,"title":"February 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-18T15:21:35.408Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T20:28:25.106Z","due_date":"2022-02-28","start_date":"2022-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/204"},"assignees":[{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"}],"author":{"id":1134865,"username":"edgarrmondragon","name":"Edgar R.

I propose we remove these from `discovery.yml` and instead direct users to use the explicit environment variable logic: `\u003cplugin_name\u003e_\u003csetting_name\u003e`.\n\nOptionally, we can preserve this functionality in case users want to add their own mappings within their `meltano.yml` files, but to my understanding, this is fully redundant with just setting the config value to be equal to the value (e.g. `value: $MY_ENV_VAL` is basically equivalent to adding the `env: MY_ENV_VAL` or `env_aliases: [MY_ENV_VAL]`).\n\nAs I understand the evolution of this featureset, the custom-named env variable aliases existing prior to the newer `\u003cplugin_name\u003e_\u003csetting_name\u003e` parsing convention. Since adding that newer convention, I think we have seen this convention go mainstream for most use cases, and we run into problems with those legacy variable names being confusing user experience if the ingestion is not expected, and/or if the order of resolution is surprising to users. See #2984 for more info on this.\n\n## Update (2022-01-24)\n\nFollowing from the notes in !2507+, we think that `env:` is serving a different function, and so this deprecation should only affect `env_aliases`. Further discussion re: `env:` can happen in !2507 and then we'll feed the findings/outcomes back into this issue.\n\n## Best reason not to build\n\nThis is a breaking change for users who are using the older (custom) environment variable names for their projects. \n\nThat said, it should be a simple fix to _either_ add the alias back to the `meltano.yml` file (as the `value:` or mapped in `env:`/`env_aliases:`) or just use the newer `\u003cplugin_name\u003e_\u003csetting_name\u003e` variable names.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-14T18:52:17.350Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T10:01:55.247Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T10:01:55.215Z","closed_by":{"id":11629953,"username":"MeltyBot","name":"Melty Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11629953/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/MeltyBot"},"labels":["Breaking Change","Configuration","Office Hours::Discussed","kind::Tech Debt","v2.0","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351599,"iid":209,"group_id":2524164,"title":"May 2022","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:23.665Z","due_date":"2022-05-31","start_date":"2022-05-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/209"},"assignees":[{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"}],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"user_notes_count":26,"merge_requests_count":3,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3120","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3120","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3120/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3120/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3120","relative":"#3120","full":"meltano/meltano#3120"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":136,"epic":{"id":421018,"iid":136,"title":"Meltano 2.0 Release","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/136","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Apr 29, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":{"id":56416,"iid":56,"sequence":3,"group_id":2524164,"title":null,"description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2022-05-13T20:04:48.839Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T00:05:02.370Z","start_date":"2022-05-23","due_date":"2022-05-29","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/iterations/56416"},"health_status":null},{"id":98980367,"iid":3118,"project_id":7603319,"title":"Research spike: can targets be tested with a zero-length input stream?","description":"In regards to applying a generic test to targets, there is some discussion regarding whether we would need to physically create a new table in the target in order to perform the test.

This is true even for mainstream packages like Postgres. https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/pip\n\n## Proposal: use an adapter-specific plugin name\n\nThese examples all use Snowflake as an example, but we would support 4 adapters at launch (same as supported today):\n\n- `dbt-bigquery`\n- `dbt-redshift`\n- `dbt-postgres`\n- `dbt-snowflake`\n\n### Installation\n\n```console\n\u003e meltano add transformer dbt-snowflake\nInstalling `dbt-snowflake`...\nInstall completed.\n```\n\n### New user experience \n\n1. A new user installing `dbt-snowflake` for the first time, would following the installation instructions above: `meltano add transformer dbt-snowflake`.\n2. After installing the dbt-snowflake transformer, they'd have 3 auto-created profiles in the auto-installed `profiles.yml` for `dbt`: 'prod', 'beta', and 'dev' - defaulting to `dev`.\n3. Without any changes to `profiles.yml`, without setting any environment variables, and without needing to invoke a tap or target, they'd have their dbt environment configurable via the `config:` block in the `dbt-snowflake` plugin definition, inside `meltano.yml`.\n\n### Migration experience\n\n1. An existing Meltano user who already has the dbt plugin installed will perform a new install: `meltano install transformer dbt-snowflake`.\n2. This will keep their existing `meltano.yml` file as-is and will likewise not affect their existing profiles file.\n3. They will now have a new `dbt-snowflake` plugin and a new profiles file: `${MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT}/transforms/profiles/snowflake/profiles.yml`.\n4. The `dbt-snowflake` plugin will point to the _new_ profiles directory and the old `dbt` plugin will still point to the _old_ profiles directory.\n5. As a one time config, the user will set any necessary config in `meltano.yml` in order to properly seed dbt profile info with the `dbt-snowflake` settings config.\n6. Whenever the user is ready, they may optionally uninstall their older `dbt` plugin entry and delete the older `profiles.yml` file. (Side-by-side execution should work in the meanwhile.)\n\n## As related to #3098 and missing special environment variables:\n\nIf we do this right, it's very likely we can also solve #3098 at the same time as launching new adapter-specific dbt plugins.\n\n- All env variables currently injected by the `extractor` or `loader` will instead be declared as `settings` registered with `env:` mappings, with their values set via standard `config:` blocks.\n    - Aka: No \"magic\" environment variables are needed, all settings go through through plugin config.\n- Migrating to adapter-specific dbt entries comes along with new adapter-specific `profiles.yml` files.\n- The migration from generic `dbt` plugin to the adapter specific ones is a one-time breaking change which allows us to flush the tech debt without breaking existing installations using the legacy `dbt` plugin definition.\n\n### Messaging re `meltano run dbt:run`\n\nAfter releasing this, we'd recommend users to migrate to adapter-specific dbt plugins if they want to use `dbt:run` and other dbt-related invocations as part of `meltano run`. (Hence, a resolution to #3098.) This would be a one time and _voluntary_ breaking change, after which they'd (1) be on the latest version of dbt and (2) have a more resilient and robust `dbt` experience in Meltano overall.\n\n## Python updates under the hood\n\nInternally:\n\nAny logic internal to Meltano core which is hardcoded to the `dbt` plugin name would need to be replaced with logic that accepts plugins with the name `dbt*`.\n\n## Pointing to adapter-specific profiles folders\n\nImportant to note is that dbt only accepts overrides for the _directory_ containing `profiles.yml`, and does not allow you to point directly to a single file. For this reason I'm proposing the files bundles have `profiles.yml` files with paths in the format `${MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT}/transform/profiles/\u003cadapter\u003e/profiles.yml` and then `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` for `dbt-snowflake` (for instance) would default to the directory `${MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT}/transform/profiles/snowflake`.\n\n## Accompanying `files` Bundles:\n\nThis should be reviewed and tested along with:\n\n- `files-dbt-biquery`: TODO\n- `files-dbt-postgres`: TODO\n- `files-dbt-redshift`: TODO\n- `files-dbt-snowflake`: https://gitlab.com/meltano/files-dbt-snowflake/-/merge_requests/2\n\n## Usability: Invocation via `dbt:run` vs `dbt-snowflake:run`\n\nIf we install adapter-specific plugins as distinct `transformer` plugins, presumably this also makes their invocation slightly more verbose.\n\n- On the 'pros' side: this makes it very simple to support multiple dbt adapters in a single project, with no ambiguity. For instance: `dbt-snowflake:run` and `dbt-athena:run` would both \"just work\".\n- On the 'cons' side: invocation is more wordy, and any sample code like `meltano run dbt:run dbt:test` is no longer copy-paste-able to other projects.\n\n@kgpayne's suggestion in #3220+ could mitigate this. Ideally, if dev time were not a factor, we'd probably alias the first dbt installation as 'dbt' and then subsequent installations would _not_ be aliased.\n\n## Previous proposals:\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Option 1: Prompt during installation.

This could also be used to select or generate a proper profile from the target definition (more discussion about auto-managed profiles in #3104).\n\n\u003c/details\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-06T22:48:32.028Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T05:24:37.887Z","closed_at":"2022-04-14T16:58:11.928Z","closed_by":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"labels":["OKR: Be the DataOps OS","Office Hours::Discussed","Roadmap","Transform","flow::Review","kind::Feature","valuestream::Meltano"],"milestone":{"id":2351598,"iid":208,"group_id":2524164,"title":"April 2022","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-29T21:38:06.797Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T14:53:27.097Z","due_date":"2022-04-30","start_date":"2022-04-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/milestones/208"},"assignees":[{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"}],"author":{"id":4809760,"username":"aaronsteers","name":"AJ Steers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3de9356eb65ac8ba021d4d3435299e?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/aaronsteers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7646034,"username":"kgpayne","name":"Ken Payne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7646034/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kgpayne"},"user_notes_count":35,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/3105","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3105","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3105/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319/issues/3105/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7603319","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3105","relative":"#3105","full":"meltano/meltano#3105"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":82,"epic":{"id":102873,"iid":82,"title":"Improved dbt integration","url":"/groups/meltano/-/epics/82","group_id":2524164,"human_readable_end_date":"Dec 31, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
