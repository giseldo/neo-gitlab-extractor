The email should use a queue and an email event.\n\nThe hashcode should be a the user's guid and a timestamp.\n\nThe user account record in cassandra should contain the date the verification time stamp was sent.\n\nWhen the user clicks the verification link with an email, the router should validate the hash with the user id and the timestamp. If the user clicked the URL within 48 hours, the hash is valid. The user's record should be updated with a \"validated_at\" timestamp and the User entity should expose an \"isValidated()\" function.\n\nThe 48 hours should be a default value in editable by helm / settings.php\n\nCurrently, we send out two emails after 2 hours of user signup. That mechanism should be replaced by this email which sends immediately. When they verify their email, then we can send either welcome_complete or welcome_incomplete based on their onboarding status\n\nFollow the \"Welcome_incomplete\" template for now and use the existing header and footer structure, but change the text to:\n\n```\n\n@name,\n\nPlease take a moment to validate your email address. This helps us prevent spam and ensure users are real.

It skips immediately to the profile setup screen. \n\nIf you try to set an avatar, display name and description, only the avatar appears correctly when you land on your channel. You have to refresh your browser in order to see your display name and your description. Very unintuitive and should not require a refresh.\n\nThe channel shows onboarding is only 83% complete even though I only did the channel set up screen and joined the rewards program.\n\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI should see all onboarding screens.\n\nI should see all my updates reflected on my channel without a refresh.\n\nPercentage of onboarding completion seems broken. 1) Hashtags 2) Channels 3) Design 4) Rewards = 100% setup. If you have not done a step, it should decrease your % complete and if you click to complete setup it needs to take you to only the steps you have not done.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-01T18:35:45.261Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T23:39:32.006Z","closed_at":"2019-12-29T23:39:31.973Z","closed_by":{"id":3341487,"username":"ottman","name":"Bill Ottman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3341487/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ottman"},"labels":["Priority::1 - High","Product::Onboarding","Status::Scheduling","Type::Bug"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":1287724,"username":"eiennohi","name":"Marcelo Rivera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b7d099e9c56b3553be6eba6e1c4517d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/eiennohi"}],"author":{"id":3341881,"username":"jotto141","name":"Jack Ottman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3341881/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jotto141"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1287724,"username":"eiennohi","name":"Marcelo Rivera","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b7d099e9c56b3553be6eba6e1c4517d8?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/eiennohi"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/912","time_stats":{"time_estimate":7200,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":"2h","human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/912","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/912/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/912/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#912","relative":"#912","full":"minds/engine#912"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":91,"epic":{"id":13742,"iid":91,"title":"Registration and Onboarding Web","url":"/groups/minds/-/epics/91","group_id":4326131,"human_readable_end_date":"Mar 10, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":25513412,"iid":909,"project_id":10171263,"title":"when getting permissions for an entity, it returns a load of permissions for unrelated entities","description":"Is this a bug?
