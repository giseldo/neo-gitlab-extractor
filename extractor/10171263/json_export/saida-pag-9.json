Go to the channel for your primary account.\n2. Click \"Attach\" and upload an image.\n3. Click \"Post\".\n4. Edit the post.\n5. Put it behind a 1 token paywall.\n6. Log out and log in to your secondary account.\n7. Visit channel for your primary account.\n8. Scroll down to the image gallery widget.\n9. Click \"View More\".\n10. Click on the thumbnail for the image.\n\n### Platform information \n\n* Windows 10 / Chrome (Version 73.0.3683.86)\n* replicated Manjaro / Chromium\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWhen you post an image, video or blog and then put it behind a paywall, it is still visible in your image/video/blog gallery for other users.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nIf you put an image/video/blog behind a paywall after you already posted it to your channel, it shouldn't be visible and accessible to users who do not meet the paywall threshold for that content. Either that or it should appear for other users but behind the paywall mask and I think both you and other users should be able to filter the image/video/blog gallery by paywalled content. Perhaps just add a button called \"Exclusive Content\" at the top of each gallery.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![image](/uploads/6b5890d74df7595829d10792c4ba71ac/image.png)\n![image](/uploads/9bcf1517a29d585f9121eb563079bd75/image.png)\n\n##### Video\nhttps://imgur.com/yRzqylz\n\n### Possible fixes\n\n(If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-03T18:52:47.041Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T19:55:55.325Z","closed_at":"2019-07-30T19:55:55.281Z","closed_by":{"id":1523497,"username":"edgebal","name":"Emiliano Balbuena","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/455cdd1ca8a8b76068c6233ac774a84f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/edgebal"},"labels":["Priority::1 - High","Product::Media","Product::Newsfeed","Status::Follow Up","Type::Bug"],"milestone":{"id":922716,"iid":24,"group_id":4326131,"title":"sprint: Interesting Iguana","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-03T09:07:13.027Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T09:22:07.932Z","due_date":"2019-07-17","start_date":"2019-07-03","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/24"},"assignees":[{"id":1523497,"username":"edgebal","name":"Emiliano Balbuena","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/455cdd1ca8a8b76068c6233ac774a84f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/edgebal"}],"author":{"id":3341806,"username":"JakePassi","name":"Jake Passi","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3341806/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/JakePassi"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1523497,"username":"edgebal","name":"Emiliano Balbuena","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/455cdd1ca8a8b76068c6233ac774a84f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/edgebal"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/458","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/458","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/458/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/458/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#458","relative":"#458","full":"minds/engine#458"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":19699409,"iid":354,"project_id":10171263,"title":"(feat): auto join help \u0026 support group when creating an account","description":"Is this a bug?

this is very important)\n\n### Platform information \n\nWindows 10, Chrome and Firefox lastest versions\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nVideo cannot be embedded\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nWe should ideally find a solution where we can mitigate the risk of click-jacking, whilst also allowing video embedding.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nMark has mentioned that this could potentially be solved by either splitting the embedded links off onto a subdomain, or we may be able to remove the header for a specific endpoint.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-25T13:31:14.521Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T21:48:05.953Z","closed_at":"2020-07-20T21:48:05.930Z","closed_by":{"id":3341487,"username":"ottman","name":"Bill Ottman","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3341487/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/ottman"},"labels":["Priority::2 -
