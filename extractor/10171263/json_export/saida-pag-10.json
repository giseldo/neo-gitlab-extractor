After helping @howtostyle set up their wallet, the transaction conmpletes, but @john wallet was debited for each failed attempt, but @howtostyle only credited once \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n@howtostyle wallet was verified with a cell number but the subsequent steps aka \"next\" was not completed linking metamask and on chain, etc. @repeated wire attempts to @howtostyle from @john fail with error, but debited @john wallet for each failed attempt and @howtostyle only credited for one successful attempt after their wallet setup was completed fully. see screen shots of both wallets\n\n### Platform information \n\nwindows chrome\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nWire sender is debited for all failed transactions, bit wire receiver is only credited for the successful transaction\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nError message should appear on sender side of the transaction \"transaction failed because receivers wallet is not set up\" also the sender should not be debited for failed transactions. Receiver should receive notif to set up their wallet in order to receive a wire transaction\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n![token_23](/uploads/509c33620f8f669c2cc8bbf7e56651b5/token_23.PNG)\n![token22](/uploads/ce644136b1762f3dde492983ca1dd32b/token22.PNG)\n### Possible fixes","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-10T00:11:43.616Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T15:46:23.194Z","closed_at":"2019-04-30T15:46:23.144Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Priority::1 -
