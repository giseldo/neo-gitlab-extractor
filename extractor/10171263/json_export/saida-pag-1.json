We made this change so that we can experiment with whether displaying a small amount of preview text increases Minds+ subscriptions https://gitlab.com/minds/minds/-/issues/3857. Because it _used_ to work, we implemented the backend change universally (e.g. NOT only for users in the experiment) and failed to consider how the teaser text would be displayed for users outside of the experiment. \n\nCurrently, for users who are not in the experiment, we are only enabling 'read more' when the post's char count is \u003e 280, but only 200 chars are exported for the teaser text. If the user isn't in the experiment, this results in teaser text looking like it just stops in the middle of a sentence, without a graceful transition (such as '...'). \n\nAs seen in /newsfeed/1485362836300369927: \n![image](/uploads/9192f58341a56c36d5c858e55ef392f0/image.png)\n\nThe easiest way to fix this as was originally intended in https://gitlab.com/minds/minds/-/issues/3857 is to \"break\" the teaser text export again, only for users who are not included in the experiment. \n\nThe change should be made in the `isStatusPost()` function in Core/Wire/Paywall/Events.php \n\n## QA\n\n\u003c!---\nConsideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed\n---\u003e\nPaywalled media teaser text \n\n## UX/Design\n\n\u003c!---\nSufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team.

For this to be reliable, the assignment of a given user to a control group or a treatment group should be as stable as possible. There is room improve this stability in the current Growthbook integration.\n\n## What needs to be done\n\n- The first time an SDK call is made to select a user/device into a feature variation (in a logged-out state), save the selected variation to a dedicated local persistent cookie for that feature\n- On all subsequent requests for a selection to a given feature (in logged-out state), first check to see whether a variation has been stored in a local persistent cookie. If so, return that value as the selection in the SDK call. If not, run the experiment assignment, and store the value as above\n\n### Dev notes\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/blob/master/src/app/modules/experiments/experiments.service.ts#L85\n\n\n- Store as a JSON object with a single key\n- Confirm that it is an experiment before using the cached assignment\n\n## QA\n\nEnsure that for transitions between logged-in and logged-out states, and transitions to different devices and browser sessions that, as much as possible, the assignment of a variation for a given feature is stable for a given user.\n\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Logged-out variation assignments are stable between browser sessions\n- [x] Logged-in variation assignments are consistent from session to session\n- [x] Logged-out and logged-in assignments are consistent as much as possible\n- [x] Rate-limiting of callbacks to Snowplow events, per-feature, are preserved as in the current implementation\n- [x] Ensure rate-limiting is as reliable as possible (in both directions: not blocking events that should go, and blocking events that shouldn't go)\n\n## Definition of Ready Checklist\n\n- [x] Definition Of Done (DoD)\n- [x] Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Weighted\n- [x] QA","state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-31T14:51:25.474Z","updated_at":"2023-05-02T12:51:08.334Z","closed_at":"2023-05-02T12:51:08.314Z","closed_by":{"id":3427199,"username":"mindsgitbot","name":"Minds Gitbot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3427199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mindsgitbot"},"labels":["Deployed::Canary/Production","Dev-team::Front","Priority::1 - High","QA::Passed","Source::Team","Status::QA","Type::Feature"],"milestone":{"id":3036455,"iid":273,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Web::39 (Apr 5, 2023–Apr 18, 2023)","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2023-03-20T13:48:18.317Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T13:48:26.951Z","due_date":"2023-04-18","start_date":"2023-04-05","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/273"},"assignees":[{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},{"id":9747679,"username":"michael4tasman","name":"Michael Robinson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ecd7a2d2521903675b922aa4eea3e25?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michael4tasman"}],"author":{"id":9747679,"username":"michael4tasman","name":"Michael Robinson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ecd7a2d2521903675b922aa4eea3e25?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michael4tasman"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2561","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":9,"completed_count":8},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2561","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2561/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2561/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2561","relative":"#2561","full":"minds/engine#2561"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":126071976,"iid":2559,"project_id":10171263,"title":"Selection of recommendations cluster, post-signup, for newly-registered users","description":"## Goal\n\nCurrently, new users, and users without any engagement data are all assigned to a default recommendations cluster.

Only offchain tokens will be supported for the initial phase. \n\nWe should use **vitess** as our datastore. Proposed schema (subject to change):\n\n### Schema / Data structure\n```\nCREATE TABLE superminds (\n  guid bigint, // Should this be the guid of the activity supermind request or another column\n  sender_guid bigint,\n  receiver_guid bigint,\n  status int, // enum\n  payment_method text,\n  payment_txid text,\n  created_timestamp timestamp,\n  updated_timestamp timestamp,\n  PRIMARY KEY (guid)\n)\n```\n\n#### Status enums\n\n| Enum | Status |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| 0 | created |\n| 1 | accepted, replied |\n| 2 | sender revoked |\n| 3 | receiver rejected |\n| 4 | payment failure |\n| 5 | request expired |\n\n### API outline\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| `DELETE` | `api/v3/supermind/{{guid}}`  | REVOKES a supermind request |\n| `POST` | `api/v3/supermind/{{guid}}/reject`  | REJECTS a supermind request and refunds the requester |\n| `GET` | `api/v3/supermind/inbox` | LISTS all supermind requests received |\n| `GET` | `api/v3/supermind/outbox` | LISTS all supermind requests sent |\n\n### Creation flow\n\nAll Supermind Requests are **Activity posts**. All Superminds Replies are both **Activity posts** and **quote posts** of the original Supermind Request.\n\nTherefore, Supermind posts should be created from the composer and pass data via payloads. \n\nFor example a request:\n\n`POST api/v2/newsfeed`\n\n```\n{\n...\n\"supermind_request\": {\n  \"receiver_guid\": \u003c\u003c guid of receiver \u003e\u003e,\n  \"payment_options\": {\n    \"method\": \"usd\",\n    \"usd_payment_intent\": \"pi_ref \u003c\u003c stripe payment intent \u003e\u003e\",\n    \"amount\": 100.00\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor example a response:\n\n`POST api/v2/newsfeed`\n```\n{\n...\n\"supermind_reply_guid\": \u003c\u003c supermind guid \u003e\u003e\n```\n\nIt is recommended to use the Minds internal events to tap into the Activity save events if possible. \n\n### Payment\n\nCards should **not** be charged until a Supermind reply has been made, instead use an authorization. Once a reply is made the card should be charged. If the card fails to charge the Supermind should be marked as `payment failed`.\n\nEnsure we add a reference to the the supermind_guid on the payment metadata. \n\nToken balances should only be charged at time of reply. Avoid using an escrow. If no fund available at time of acceptance, mark as payment failed, insufficient funds. \n\n### Expiry\n\nSupermind requests expire after 7 days. Card holds should be automatically released after this time. Only status `created` Superminds can expire. \n\n### Talking points\n\n- Confusion over supermind request and supermind reply. Designs have the same badge on both, but they need to be distinguished. \n- Audit state changes. Consider snowplow. \n\n## QA\n\n\u003c!---\nConsideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed\n---\u003e\n\n\n## UX/Design\n\n\u003c!---\nSufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team.
