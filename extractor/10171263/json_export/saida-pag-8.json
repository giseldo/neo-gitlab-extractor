Although I doubt that devices matter in this, I'm on Chromebook and Mac Air/High Sierra/Firefox. Minds has given us a sub-channel of our published blogposts. Nice touch. However, I had a massive amount of unlisted blogposts, which have suddenly vanished...and many of my published ones, several the work of months each, are missing. The article below for example comes from my Gail McGowan Mellor channel. It was the product of months of research, writing and fielding comments, yet missing completely from the new blog gallery set-up.\n\n\u003e I retrieved it from way down the list in the Boost Console.\n\n\u003e Anything never boosted (ALL my unlisted work) is of course not retrievable that way. As worrying, although I can get this particular article from Boost, republishing it does not make it show up in the new blogpost listing.\n\n\u003e I've lost access to at least 4/5 of my work. Please restore the previous set-up. I cannot even inventory the amount of loss, which is not balanced by a glitzy new format.\n\nThis is critically important because some blog posters like @authorpendragon, but incredibly amounts of effort into their blogs, and the drafts can take months to finalise. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)\n\n### Platform information \n\nChromebook and Mac Air/High Sierra/Firefox\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe user cannot see the majority of their blog drafts\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe user should be able to see all of their previous blog drafts.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nI believe the workaround to this is to re-index the post manually. Regardless this should not be necessary.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-26T20:10:42.085Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T14:26:34.780Z","closed_at":"2021-10-19T14:26:34.774Z","closed_by":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"labels":["Priority::3 - Low","Product::Blogs","Product::Platform","Status::Validation","T - Triage","Team::Engagement"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/464","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/464","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/464/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/464/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#464","relative":"#464","full":"minds/engine#464"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":21278033,"iid":462,"project_id":10171263,"title":"(fix): Add pagination to Subscriber/Subscriptions Ban Snapshot delegates","description":"Is this a bug?
