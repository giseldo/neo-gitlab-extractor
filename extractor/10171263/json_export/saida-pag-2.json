Each user needs a cryptographic keypair to sign posts with (these are called \"events\").\n  2. Then user' posts must be accessible from a relay that speaks the Nostr protocol.\n  3. User metadata is published in the same way as a post is, it just has a different `kind` number and a different structure.\n  4. Finally, Nostr currently supports linking readable names (\"internet identifiers\") like `myname@minds.com` to public keys.\n\nI'm not familiar with the Minds codebase and couldn't figure out much from a quick glance, but from using the website I imagine you have a database with users and each user has an ID and metadata like name, unique username, image and description -- and then you have posts associated with each user.\n\nConsidering that, we can solve the above points as following:\n\n1. Minds can just generate a key for each user. This can be done in a single step that populates a database column for each user with a random private key; or it can be generated using a fixed formula that takes the user unique ID from the Minds database itself and applies something like `hmac(secret, id)` to get a private key (in this case if the formula doesn't change and the ID for each doesn't change either the private key will always be the same -- and you can always migrate later to a private key that is saved on the database if you want).\n2. Minds would run a Nostr relay that would respond to clients that connect to it from the external world through a websocket with lists of events from Minds users. The queries can vary, but basically they will be requesting a all posts of some kind or multiple kinds for a given user or multiple users -- nothing much different from what the current Minds frontend already uses I believe. This can be done in multiple ways too, but to me it seems like the best way (and the path of least resistance) would be to run a custom relays as a separate instance that will have access to the main Minds database such that upon receiving a request from a Nostr client it would\n   1. Query the database for all the requested content;\n   2. Process the content from whatever the format it is in the Minds database such that it will become a set of standard Nostr events;\n   3. Use the private key associated with the user that created the content to sign the event;\n   4. Return the event to the client;\n   5. Keep the websocket connection open such that whenever a new event that passes the filter is generated on Minds the relay is notified and can then send this new event to all listening clients that want it (this is so events are received in real-time by Nostr clients without refreshes -- it's slightly more complicated than the rest of the flow, so I imagine it could be done at a later date).\n3. Metadata is basically an event like the other ones so it follow the same pattern as above.\n4. Along with the metadata each user would also have a \"name@minds.com\" tag attached to it based on their minds.com URL and there would be a very simple global handler for resolving these names to pubkeys on the minds.com domain (see https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr/blob/master/nips/05.md) -- mine, for example, would be `fiatjaf@minds.com` and then Nostr clients would query `https://minds.com/.well-known/nostr.json?name=fiatjaf` so the global handler could query the database and figure out the public key associated with the username \"fiatjaf\" and return that as NIP05 specifies.\n\nI believe the Minds Nostr relay code could (at least initially) make use of https://github.com/fiatjaf/relayer which I wrote as \"Relay Framework\" (it's a library) that can be instantiated with custom database backends and custom responses etc.\n\n---\n\nThere are other ways to do the integration and I believe @jb55 has suggested doing it in a slightly different way, but these are cleanest and more elegant ways to do it with the least resistance in my opinion.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-28T23:48:30.242Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T23:53:29.512Z","closed_at":"2022-05-25T12:32:07.860Z","closed_by":{"id":3427199,"username":"mindsgitbot","name":"Minds Gitbot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3427199/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mindsgitbot"},"labels":["Deployed::Canary/Production","Dev-team::Backend","Priority::2 - Medium","QA::Passed","Source::Community","Status::QA","Team::Platform","Type::Feature"],"milestone":{"id":2560862,"iid":216,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Dev::16 (May 11, 2022–May 24, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-04-11T13:30:15.568Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T14:07:41.681Z","due_date":"2022-05-27","start_date":"2022-05-11","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/216"},"assignees":[{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"}],"author":{"id":857958,"username":"fiatjaf","name":"fiatjaf","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b760f503c84d1bf47322f401066c753f?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fiatjaf"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2311","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":0},"weight":13,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2311","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2311/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2311/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2311","relative":"#2311","full":"minds/engine#2311"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":211,"epic":{"id":488184,"iid":211,"title":"Decentralize Minds publishing","url":"/groups/minds/-/epics/211","group_id":4326131,"human_readable_end_date":"Jun 30, 2022","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":107216910,"iid":2307,"project_id":10171263,"title":"Implement ability to resolve other DID's","description":"\u003c!---\nPlease read this!\n\nThe Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor\n\nBefore opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues\nfiltered by the \"Type::Feature\" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n## Goal\n\n\u003c!---\nClearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it\n---\u003e\n\nWe need to be able to read other DID documents to continuing our Self Sovereign Identity goal. \n\n## What needs to be done\n\n\u003c!---\nClearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above\n---\u003e\n\nThere are a **lot** of did methods, and maintaining our own drivers for each is going to be a mammoth task.

To resolve this we can prefix the command with `sh` in the `ENTRYPOINT` exec list.\n\nAfter resolving this, the run still fails as at least one of the tests are using type declarations which are not supported with PHP 7.3 (the current version specified for the parent image).\n\n```bash\nParse error: syntax error, unexpected 'bool' (T_STRING), expecting function (T_FUNCTION) or const (T_CONST) in /var/www/Minds/engine/vendor/symfony/event-dispatcher-contracts/Event.php on line 33\n```\n\nTo resolve this, we could update the parent image to to `minds/php:8.0`. After a global search on the project it seems to me that the `minds/phpspec` container is only used by the local CLI, however I would appreciate feedback on this in case I missed anything.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTo reproduce, you can run `minds rebuild \u0026\u0026 minds phpspec`. For me this fails in `master`, but all tests pass with my suggested changes.\n\n### Platform information \n\nI'm using Linux Mint 20.3 (Ubuntu 20.04) for this, however I would think that these issues are platform agnostic.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nBackend tests fail when executing them with the local Minds CLI (`minds phpspec`).\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nAll tests should pass when executing the above command.","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-22T04:49:17.674Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T08:46:26.727Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T17:02:33.218Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Ad hoc","Dev-team::Infrastructure","Priority::2 - Medium","Product::Development","Severity::3 - Low","Source::Team","Status::Backlog","Type::Infrastructure"],"milestone":{"id":2443080,"iid":212,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Dev::12 (Mar 16, 2022 – Mar 29, 2022)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-28T22:29:02.864Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T10:54:14.834Z","due_date":"2022-03-29","start_date":"2022-03-16","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/212"},"assignees":[{"id":10988173,"username":"zackwy","name":"Zack Wynne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10988173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zackwy"}],"author":{"id":10988173,"username":"zackwy","name":"Zack Wynne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10988173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zackwy"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":10988173,"username":"zackwy","name":"Zack Wynne","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/10988173/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/zackwy"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2270","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2270","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2270/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2270/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2270","relative":"#2270","full":"minds/engine#2270"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":105743508,"iid":2282,"project_id":10171263,"title":"Users are clicking expired email verification links","description":"### Target problem\n\nA high percentage of users who create accounts on Minds don't use the app after 2 hours. Tasman has identified a common pattern with these users:\n\n- They haven't verified their email address\n- They have multiple events showing them clicking the \"Resend\" button on email verification\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n- Verification emails end up in the user's spam folder and get missed\n- If a user clicks \"Resend\" and later finds the emails in their spam folder, they may follow a verification link in an older verification email -- which will have expired and give them an error.\n\n- [ ] Re-using the same verification link rather than generating a new one every time the user clicks \"resend,\" will result in a higher % of users who register. OR not expiring previous verification links after a new one is sent will have the same effect.\n\n### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?\n\nDaily registrations (email verifications) / Daily signups (new accounts created), can be measured in the [Growth Dashboard](https://analytics.minds.com/superset/dashboard/32/?native_filters=%28NATIVE_FILTER-jhvp9Gs1E%3A%28__cache%3A%28label%3AAuthentic%2CvalidateMessage%3A%21f%2CvalidateStatus%3A%21f%2Cvalue%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%2CextraFormData%3A%28filters%3A%21%28%28col%3Aaccount_type%2Cop%3AIN%2Cval%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%29%29%2CfilterState%3A%28label%3AAuthentic%2CvalidateMessage%3A%21f%2CvalidateStatus%3A%21f%2Cvalue%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%2Cid%3ANATIVE_FILTER-jhvp9Gs1E%2CownState%3A%28%29%29%29).\n\n### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?\n\nCurrently conversion is ~30%; 90%+ seems like a realistic goal for an action with such strong intent as signup.\n\n### Size estimate\n\n(Size estimate -- from Design + Dev -- required to deliver this change.

It should only be accessible to logged-in users.\n\nThe endpoint should call a function in the SKALE `Controller`, which in turn should call a function in the SKALE `Manager`, that generates a new SKALE transaction to send an amount of skETH (see below \"How much should we send\" section).\n\nThis amount should be configurable in our `settings.php`.\nThe gas price per unit should also be configurable in our `settings.php` and exported to the front-end in the `skale` section of our blockchain config.\n\n#### Front\n\nThe front-end will need modifying with all SKALE calls first checking the balance, using modified contract functions with an estimateGas param [as here](https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2144#note_740426909). We need to get the amount of gas required, multiply it by the gas price, then check a users balance to determine whether they have enough funds - if they do, we can let them withdraw, if they do not, we need to make a request to the engine endpoint above, then we should either:\n\n* Implement a waiting state where a user waits for the tx, then metamask opens.\n* Simply throw a toast warning saying we've send some skETH so they can make the transaction, and ask them to wait a short while and try again. \n\n### How much should we send\n\n44,005 is the largest amount of gas I found required [digging through the block explorer](http://glamorous-syrma.explorer.dappnet.skalenodes.com/tx/0x0cc4191e7807b7e8bfdff2ceb2c7349afd87c090be6c517bbfc13850b0075fe9/internal-transactions). We can see this tx cost `0.0000000044005 skETH`. I think initially an amount of `0.00000022 SKETH` would provide enough for 50 of those large contract interactions, and sustain a user for quite a whilst, while remaining sustainable for us to distribute.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-24T12:03:47.573Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T13:50:32.979Z","closed_at":"2022-01-27T13:50:32.957Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Priority::3 -

Bug\" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.\n---\u003e\n\n### Summary\n\nWe need to come up with a solution for withdrawal payout transactions getting stuck. It is stressful for our members and puts strain on our admin team to be managing so many withdrawal issues.\n\nAssess regression scope and time constraints.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIt is not known exactly how this can be replicated at present, but one suspected frequent way this would happen is by approving two transactions in quick succession.\n\n### Platform information \n\nCross-browser web.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMembers transaction appears as approved, but is not written to the chain.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMember's transaction should be written to the chain.\n\n### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,\nlogs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)\n\n### Possible fixes\n\nFirst - good read up on nonce handling here https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/2809 - a bit old but the information should still be accurate.\n\n#### Diagnostic steps\n\n###### 1. Monitoring\nLog new transactions being dispatched on the backend in Sentry, with their nonce in the log string. This way we could monitor if there are any conflicts occurring, and see the patterns of nonce distribution to confirm or disprove the nonce collision hypothesis.\n\n###### 2. Manually check failed TXs visibility in Infura\nMake a note of the txid's of any failed payouts and query the Infura API to see if there is any way we can figure out what has happened - possibly via `eth_getTransactionByHash`.\n\n#### Solutions to evaluate\n\n##### 1. Nonce Cache\nIf it is found that the issues are with nonce conflicts, its entirely possible that upon deciding to dispatch a transaction with a new nonce, we could cache the nonce we've dispatched last, and increment there - there IS some logic here already but if an issue is found, it's obviously not working. Perhaps this is because pending doesn't include transactions that haven't hit the mem-pool yet, perhaps it's because of a bug in the code, perhaps it's because we're not using a shared instance of the class. \n\n![image](/uploads/c782da8f55c25c32fa1afeeb49c63e86/image.png)\n\n##### 2. TX queue with Pulsar\nA bit weightier a task, and IMO if we're going this route we should probably look to expand out into a Web3 microservice sooner rather than later; but we could refactor transactions out into a transactions queue, that awaits a transactions success status before moving onto the next one. The issue with this would be what happens when and if it gets stuck? Do we build in auto-retry logic?\n\n##### 3. ITX with Infura (or Alchemy equivalent).\n[ITX with Infura](https://infura.io/docs/transactions#section/Developing-with-ITX) may not be possible because I've not yet determined whether meta-transactions are possible with our contracts.\nRegardless it would offer a solid solution to these kinds of issues AND gas pricing. It should be checked whether Alchemy offers a similar product.\n\n##### 4. Do not allow admins to approve another withdrawal until the last is confirmed.\nThis is no doubt the option that would slow the admin team down the most, but is possibly the simplest. If we can determine from Infura that a transaction is still pending, we can simply throw an error when trying to approve the next transaction.\n\nFor improved UX, we could block the UI from making further requests with some kind of \"in progress\" indicator, and revoke the in-progress state when the tx is confirmed via sockets.\n\n##### 5. Transaction retrier\n\nWe could build a state between `PENDING_APPROVAL` and `CONFIRMED`, \"`DISPATCHED`\" - a runner could iterate through \"`DISPATCHED`\" transactions periodically and redispatch any that have not been written to chain, or move them to `CONFIRMED`. We could also move to confirmed separately by listening to changes on the blockchain, similar to how we monitor for `PENDING =\u003e PENDING_APPROVAL`.\n\n##### 6. Refactor Contracts\nExpensive, difficult, and time-consuming but worth a mention. We could refactor contracts and architect withdrawals a bit differently, for example using a funding pool similar to SKALEs CommunityPool, where-in a user would deposit into a pool that they are free to withdraw from as they like - this pool could be used to pay for approvals. There are other ways that could be architected but that is one idea that comes to mind.\n\n##### 7. Wait for L2 / Sidechain integration.\nWith L2 and sidechain integration, we should see quicker transaction resolution times which in theory should mean fewer issues.\n\n\n### Additional resources\n\nThis is a known failed TX payout `0x05d3668a98737f7db00ac2d864b94cdb257aa1ce87b67b9e940540ca0e5f503d` from a couple of days ago -

Users have to have it to send transactions, and we need a method to distribute it to them.\n\nWe will need to investigate either:\n\n##### 1. Distribution mechanisms for skETH \n\n* From a central wallet that users can request funds from?\n* From a contract?\n* Share X amount across all active wallets, give new accounts some? (how would users then get more?)\n\nI'm concerned about the chance for Sybil attacks if we were to distribute the skETH ourselves. Though there's no monetary value associated with it, I do anticipate us having to try devise a Sybil-resistant distribution mechanism to prevent malicious users from trying to hoard skETH. This for example is an issue for things like Rinkeby ETH, where people try to hoard it despite it being valueless - thus faucets usually have to connect to Twitter to verify a users uniqueness.\n\n##### 2. Allow members to mine in browser for skETH.\n\nEven though its a very simple and lightweight in terms of operations (presuming this is the bulk of the logic https://github.com/skalenetwork/pow-demo/blob/main/skale-miner.js), this option would technically be building a miner into our web app, unless we spin a separate app up on a subdomain. We need to spin that demo app up locally so that we can get a full grasp of how things like a new block being proposed happen in any case to fully evaluate the option.\n\nVarious examples of methods of handling this can be found at:\n* https://github.com/skalenetwork/pow-demo \n* https://docs.skale.network/skaled/3.7.x/skale-chain-eth","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-11-15T19:24:20.086Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T12:16:08.622Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T12:16:08.617Z","closed_by":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"labels":["Dev-team::Front","Product::Wallet","Type::Feature"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"}],"author":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3394674,"username":"benhayward.ben","name":"Ben","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3394674/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/benhayward.ben"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2144","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2144","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2144/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2144/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2144","relative":"#2144","full":"minds/engine#2144"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":168,"epic":{"id":371364,"iid":168,"title":"SKALE integration","url":"/groups/minds/-/epics/168","group_id":4326131},"iteration":{"id":37942,"iid":4,"sequence":3,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::4 (Nov 17 -

This will allow us to easily change the recommendations and run experiments from a single place. The frontend only needs to support a simple component that can render the entities.  \n\n### Example API Call\n\n#### GET `api/v3/recommendations/?location=feed-sidebar`\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"wider-network\",\n  \"entities\": [ ],\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"inferred\",\n  \"entities\": [ ],\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"favourite-subscribed-posts\",\n  \"entities\": [ ],\n}\n```\n\n### Example queries\n\n#### Wider network\nThis will return entities from my wider network (ie. content that my subscribers have interacted with.\n\n#### Inferred \nThis will return entities based on content that I have interacted","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-06T13:48:19.979Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T17:19:09.218Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T17:19:09.200Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Dev-team::Backend","Priority::1 - High","Product::Newsfeed","Source::Team","Status::Review","Team::Engagement","Type::Feature"],"milestone":{"id":2406078,"iid":208,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::5 (Dec 1, 2021 – Dec 14, 2021)","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-06T09:38:18.849Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T17:00:53.556Z","due_date":"2021-12-14","start_date":"2021-12-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/milestones/208"},"assignees":[{"id":4508086,"username":"fausto.arci","name":"Fausto Arcidiacono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4508086/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fausto.arci"}],"author":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4508086,"username":"fausto.arci","name":"Fausto Arcidiacono","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4508086/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/fausto.arci"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2108","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":5},"weight":20,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2108","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2108/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263/issues/2108/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10171263","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2108","relative":"#2108","full":"minds/engine#2108"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":{"id":39114,"iid":5,"sequence":4,"group_id":4326131,"title":"Sprint::5 (Dec 1, 2021 – Dec 14, 2021)","description":null,"state":3,"created_at":"2021-11-02T09:22:10.978Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T00:05:02.498Z","start_date":"2021-12-01","due_date":"2021-12-14","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/iterations/39114"},"health_status":null}]
