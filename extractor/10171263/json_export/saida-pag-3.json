If you do not log in at the time someone posts something that gets good engagement, the chances are you will not scroll deep enough into your newsfeed to see it, therefore never seeing it.\n\nMinds has a stance that they will remain committed to the reverse chronological feed by default to ensure creators reach 100% of their audience.\n\n## Goal\n\nAllow users to filter their newsfeed by top content to make sure they see the best content from the people they subscribe to. Keep reverse chronological newsfeed (latest feed) as the default option, but remember the feed that the user was last on for when they come back.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\nBy exposing the best subscribed content to users in their newsfeed, there will be many benefits:\n\n- Creators will receive more engagement\n- Consumers will have more popular content in their feeds to keep them engaged\n- The global trending feed will improve because subscribed content will get more engagement\n\nTherefore, we should monitor the following KPI's to assess the success of this change:\n\n- Retention\n- Total votes, comments, reminds\n\n## Design\n\nUse Top/Latest filter design from search and discovery.\n\n## Logic\n\nTo try and surface the best, most relevant content to a user in their newsfeed when they sort by Top:\n\n1. Prioritize content from subscriptions who they engage with the most frequently that they have not yet engaged with (ex: jack very frequently engages with bill's posts, therefore prioritize recent posts from bill that jack has not yet engaged with). \n\n2. Rank subscribed content based on highest engagement score in the past 72 hours. The algorithm would be: (Unique Votes * 1) + (Unique Comments * 2) + (Unique Reminds * 4). We could also just mimic the algorithm used in discovery currently.\n\n3. To ensure that a single popular user does not take every spot in your top feed, only allow a single user to take up one slot for every 12 available slots.\n\n4. To ensure that the top feed does not get stale throughout the course of the day, prioritize posts that the user has not already engaged with in the top feed. \n\n\n## Other potential factors\n\n- whether a user has seen a post already or not\n\n\n## Navigation\n\nAside from the Top/Latest filter on top of the newsfeed, we should do everything we can to encourage users to visit the Top newsfeed as this will be the best content for them to see.\n\nTo encourage this navigation, we should insert a \"Top Post\" entity that is similar to the \"Boosted Post\" entities in the newsfeed. Every X posts, insert a \"Top Post\" that a user has not engaged with to ensure more visibility on the best posts in their newsfeed.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-13T19:20:25.573Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T16:16:39.749Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T12:32:38.615Z","closed_by":{"id":294376,"username":"markharding","name":"Mark Harding","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/294376/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markharding"},"labels":["Platform::Browser","Priority::1 -
