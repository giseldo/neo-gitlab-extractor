It is easy for me to create a new campaign and I can find out how to join existing games easily. I can also upload an image to as as a display image for campaigns.\n\n## Details\n\nCurrently, we're displaying all campaigns.  This will not do when we release First Playable. This is the first experience more players will have with this product. We should allow them to test it out very easily.\n\n## Steps\n\n- [x] On campaign features page a \"choose file\" and \"upload\" buttons should be added to \"Create New Campaign\" section in order to select a banner image, upload it, and associate it to the campaign which has been created.\n\n- [x] Users should have a main Campaign page where he/she can see the created campaigns, and interact with them.\n\n- [x] Once a campaign is created it should have a button like \"info\" to display all the information about it, such as campaign creation date, last time played, description, invite link, delete campaign, and play button.\n\n- [x] Clicking on \"Delete\" button should remove a campaign from the main view campaing page, and clicking on \"Edit\" button should update campaign's content such as description, banner, and etc.\n\n- [x] Campaign Description textarea on \"Create New Campaign\" page should have enough \"cols\", \"rows\" and length in order to convey necessary information for the campaign.\n\n- [x] Menu creation on header next to the logo.\n\n- [x] Start Date and Last Played must be implemented on campaign's description field.\n\n- [x] Campaign's images should not be stretched or skewed.\n\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] User can upload image as a banner for their campaign. It should be displayed in the campaign list page without distortion (Uploaded banner should be displayed in campaigns list page without distortion.)\n- [x] User can create a campaign description which scan be viewed entirely in the campaign info card. (campaigns description should fit in textarea field in campaigns list page)\n- [x] User can display additional information not shown in the campaign card on an Info Card. (info button should display all the campaign's information on the right side of the page and having scroll down feature.)\n- [x] User can enjoy a campaign manager which matches the light-theme standards. (Light-theme (Needs clarification @mfaulise))\n- [x] User can see the date the campaign was created on and the last date the campaign was played. (Display campaigns' creation and 'last played' dates correctly.)\n- [x] User can delete the campaign through targeted clicking/2 step deletion verification and have it removed from the campaign list page (Clicking \"Delete\" in the Info pop-up removes the campaign from the list page. )\n- [x] User can access the Campaign Editor through the Info Card.

We should move to a different default branch name for Mythic Table for two reasons:\n\n1. master is not easily understood by people new to Git, and is not a ubiquitous term in technology (master is more easily associated with primary/secondary configurations)\n1. master has multiple meanings in English, including master/slave. Although Git does not use master/slave terminology, such terminology was common until recently. Use of master/slave terminology has been removed in recent versions of many major software projects because it is not technically descriptive, precise, and avoids needlessly referencing the awful history and impact of human/slavery which continues to be felt by people all over the world.\n\n## Steps\n\n- [x] change pipeline to use main instead of master for deployment\n- [x] create main branch from master\n- [x] make main the default branch\n- [x] update release processes to use main branch\n- [x] update Developer documentation\n- [ ] ... probably many other steps\n- [x] remove master branch\n\n\u003c!-- A note on weights\n0 is trivial.

Doing so generates a linked persistent Game Session that uses the red keep map and has a number of tokens on it. \n\n## IMPORTANT\n\nThis is another very large story.  When working on this, consider doing one of the following\n\n### Using tasks\n\nCreate a subtask from this story and then branch from it\n\n```\ngit checkout -b issue/82-step-1-for-story-48\n```\n\nMerge each completed step into `master`\n\n### Branch for task\n\nCreate a subtask from this story and then branch from it\n\n```\ngit checkout -b issue/48-step-2-decoupled-campaign-data\n```\n\nMerge each completed step into `master`\n\n## Details\n\nWhen a campaign is created via the Campaign Management APIs, it should also initialize a base state for a campaign and save it to persistent storage. Currently, this base state is represented by [data_demo.js](https://gitlab.com/mythicteam/mythictable/-/blob/master/html/src/debug/data_demo.js) on the front end.\n\nOn the back end, we need to store a session template with the map and some default icons (use the existing data_demo.js for reference). We need this template to be copied and linked to a campaign ID when a new Campaign is created. When the front end requests a Live session for that campaign ID, the back end should provide the session template as the initial state.\n\nThe front end should request the Live session for each campaign, rather than the Demo live session.\n\nExplicitly out of scope for this story:\n\n*  Persisting further changes to the Game State\n*  Limiting visibility of state changes within the campaign (covered by #49).\n\n## Suggested Steps\n\nThe goal of this to help build an API that will allow the server to populate the map. The end result to the user should not change. The following steps will help ensure that these changes do not impact the end user.\n\nAt each of these steps, the system NEEDS to be tested to ensure it's still functioning as expected.\n\n1. [x] Find and document all data used to populate the map and tokens in-game\n1. [x] Build a decoupled data representation of available data. It can be hardcoded in json for this step.\n1. [x] Replace the inline data from step one with a reference to the data made in step two.\n1. [x] Draft an API to fetch campaign data. This API MUST take a campaign ID\n1. [x] Have the campaign data URL return the fake data from step 2\n1. [x] Make sure the campaign ID is sent from the server when a user enters the campaign\n1. [x] console log the campaign id `onload` of the in-game interface\n1. [x] Replace the reference created in step three with a call to the new campaign data API\n1. [x] Add a step in the create campaign controller to initialize a campaign data object based on the data in step two. Randomize the positions of the tokens in the campaign.\n1. [x] Change the API hardcoded in step five to reference the campaign data initialize\n1. [x] Verify that loading into campaigns shows the correct state - campaign A's tokens should be positioned differently from campaign B, but campaign A's tokens should keep the same position on a reload\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] After creating a new Campaign, players can click the Play link to go to that campaign's instance of the game session.\n- [x] Clicking the Play link on a different campaign will take players to a different game session instance.\n- [x] Player can load into one campaign, move a token, load into a different campaign, note the token appears to be at its original location and then load into the first campaign and see the token in the new location.\n- [ ] Player can load into one campaign, roll a dice, load into a different campaign, note and empty dice log and then load into the first campaign and see the dice he had rolled earlier.\n\n## Data concerns\n\nShould the initial game state be stored under the Campaign document, or in a separate document linked by ID? I lean towards the latter, to allow the live session data to be split it into a separate service in the future, but am open to alternatives.\n\n## Security concerns\n\nUsers should only be able to join the game session if they are an Owner or a Player.\n\n## Stages\n\n- [ ] Planned accepted\n- [ ] Code Complete\n- [ ] Contains tests\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] Contains log changes\n- [ ] Analytics included\n- [ ] Deployed to `edge`\n- [ ] Announced","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-06T00:03:13.016Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T01:26:57.602Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T01:26:57.549Z","closed_by":{"id":3457551,"username":"mfaulise","name":"Marc Faulise","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3457551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfaulise"},"labels":["phase::active","type::story"],"milestone":{"id":1000937,"iid":2,"project_id":14052249,"title":"First Playable","description":"# Brief \r\nThe **First Playable Milestone** represents the work necessary to build the first official release of Mythic Table.\r\n# Hypothesis\r\nThis Milestone tests if a playable prototype is sufficient to gather interest in Mythic Table as a viable Virtual Tabletop.

When a player attempts an action which directly affects an authorized object, that action is sent as a message to our servers. If a Game Master is present, the message is sent to him for approval. When enabled, Auto Resolution will automatically approve the action, and the game state will be updated. Of course, we’re not the first ones to think of this, d20pro has this feature, but our feature will do so much more:\n\n1. Our unique history viewer will allow a Game Master to undo unwanted actions quickly.\n2. Auto Resolution can be enabled on a player by player basis. This feature allows you to control which players can have their actions automatically resolved or to stop trouble-making players from affecting everyone’s \n3. Auto Resolution works with player to player actions allowing players to affect each other when the Game Master is not online\n4. Our unique feedback system notifies the player when an action has been undone.\n5. Our system has a redo option for times when a player has corrected the action. This redo will allow them to preserve their original results.\n6. Our system will allow the Game Master to edit the action if something has been forgotten. This feature is useful for situations when a buff was forgotten, or the game has some house rule for which the action has not accounted.\n\nThis issue will track the initial discussion, requirements analysis and MVP implementation of this central feature.\n\nThe slack channel dedicated for it is: #feature-autoresolution","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-13T21:16:20.965Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T04:50:28.433Z","closed_at":"2021-01-22T04:50:28.399Z","closed_by":{"id":3457551,"username":"mfaulise","name":"Marc Faulise","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3457551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfaulise"},"labels":["Acceptance Needed","area::server","phase::idea","type::story"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":1833346,"username":"LennDG","name":"Lennart De Graef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a0c0df07197ac531defd4ca1ae7caa0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/LennDG"},{"id":3457551,"username":"mfaulise","name":"Marc Faulise","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3457551/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mfaulise"}],"author":{"id":1833346,"username":"LennDG","name":"Lennart De Graef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a0c0df07197ac531defd4ca1ae7caa0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/LennDG"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1833346,"username":"LennDG","name":"Lennart De Graef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3a0c0df07197ac531defd4ca1ae7caa0?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/LennDG"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mythicteam/mythictable/-/issues/6","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":20,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/14052249/issues/6","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/14052249/issues/6/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/14052249/issues/6/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/14052249","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6","relative":"#6","full":"mythicteam/mythictable#6"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24777253,"iid":5,"project_id":14052249,"title":"Mythic Table Community Forum","description":"The Mythic Table Community Forum is a place for community members to meet and talk about a variety of subjects.
