Data Pipeline input and output data","description":"### Observed behaviour\n\nWhen creating a pipeline (eg. data processing pipeline, data visualization or experiment), the resulting branch that is created contains from its start all files present in the origin branch. \n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWe are currently using branches to store the output of a branch. As long as we have this system, the origin files should not be in the newly created pipeline branch (such as data-pipeline/XXX branch).\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen dev environment, start a processing pipeline, navigate to data instance (or in gitlab backend) to see the content of this branch.\n\n\n### Terminology\n\n@rainerkern do you think this ticket makes sense in the perspective of (hopefully) switching to a better storing mechanism (buckets)? \n\n\n### Solution\nThe technical implementation of this can look similar to how Maven does it. In Maven, there exists a general output folder and every script generates a separate folder within that. Subsequent scripts can then easily access the previous results.\n\nWe can (and probably should) do something similar. For example, if a pipeline consists of three scripts:\n\n1. Every Data Pipeline script per default needs an input and an output folder.\n2. The EPF (`mlreef.yaml`) takes the original `data` folder as input for the first script in the pipeline and directs the output to a temporary location (e.g. `output/1`)\n3. The EPF uses `output/1` as input for the second script and directs its output to `output/2`\n4. Then the EPF uses `output/2` as input for the third script and directs its output to `output/3`\n5. Then, at last, the `data` folder is cleared and the contents from `output/3` are moved to `data` and subsequently persisted as the Data Instance\n\n**Mixing Data:**\nIf the user decides that he wants to original input data and the output data mixed together, in step `5` the input data is **NOT** deleted from the `data` folder\n\nThis functionality can also be added for each step. So the data from each step is propagated to the output folder\n\n@cpmlreef create designs in frontend.\n\n**Storage:**\nThis description is still completely agnostic of the type of storage that will be used; be it S3, FTP, or GIT.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-02-12T19:00:38.478Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T12:31:57.556Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T19:23:37.271Z","closed_by":{"id":5493598,"username":"erika.torres","name":"Erika Torres","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5493598/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/erika.torres"},"labels":["epf","feature","roadmap::build","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1196902,"iid":11,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Alpha 4","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-17T09:24:43.284Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T09:37:23.753Z","due_date":"2020-05-15","start_date":"2020-04-27","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/11"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":3839940,"username":"cpmlreef","name":"cpmlreef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3839940/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cpmlreef"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/319","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/319","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/319/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/319/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#319","relative":"#319","full":"mlreef/mlreef#319"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":30688756,"iid":318,"project_id":12894267,"title":"Navigate in folder tree in select data modal","description":"### Problem to Solve\n\nAs a User I want to be able to navigate in the folder structure to select files within folders.

The current version, the loading spinner, is to intrusive and blocks everything. \n\nWe need asynchonous loading in this order:\n1. Loading of the folder tree and files \n2. Loading of \"last commit and last date\"\n3. Loading of the weights of files and quantity of files in a folder\n\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n\n\n## Additional Notes\nWhile the data for \"last commit\", and \"last date\" is beeing loaded it can just be left blank and appear as soon as the data is available. As seen here:\n\n![image](/uploads/28265ec2d2b118faeb83ba54b8ad4901/image.png)\n\nTo show the user that something is going on, we replace the MLReef logo in the navbar with this GIF (so does it GitLab as well): \n\n![MLReef_w](/uploads/2330ef8acba3e6fc8e45c71488528140/MLReef_w.gif)\n\n![image](/uploads/4a20611b379f1f9b2332cd4537bd79f4/image.png)\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nFiles API has a limit of 100 files, therefore to calculate a folder size cannot be done via API requests. For future tickets think about weight and count files in the backend and persist that information, so that there will be always a kind of report to ease the access and calculations.\n\nTo get the last commit information, it is possible to try in the future with its own gitlab instance the next API:\nhttps://gitlab.com/mlreef/frontend/refs/develop/logs_tree/.vscode?format=json\n\nFor the moment, we cannot fully access this API but our own instance can be a solution.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-23T15:37:26.559Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T17:52:46.299Z","closed_at":"2020-04-29T14:07:46.239Z","closed_by":{"id":3839940,"username":"cpmlreef","name":"cpmlreef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3839940/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cpmlreef"},"labels":["feature","frontend","priority::3-low","roadmap::create"],"milestone":{"id":920133,"iid":3,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Future Backlog","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2019-07-01T10:35:03.292Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T08:11:44.650Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2022-01-01","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/3"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4009135,"username":"systemkern","name":"Systemkern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4009135/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/systemkern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/37","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":1,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/37","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/37/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/37/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#37","relative":"#37","full":"mlreef/mlreef#37"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":23004132,"iid":29,"project_id":12894267,"title":"Data Repo Overview Menus and Functions","description":"the repository overview has a number of different drop down menus and functions.\nWe should include the components of the variants as described in the XD files.\n\nLink to original data repo XD files: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/6af7ea58-6fe4-4a18-5db1-9c5e7dd598f2-1cc6/grid\n\nIn variant B: No deeper functionallity here.\nIn variant C: The search function will not work, but showing the branches should (with working links).
