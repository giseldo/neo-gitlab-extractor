in data visualization overview and details view","description":"[MLReef's Glossary](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/-/tree/master/handbook/glossary.md)\n\n### Problem to solve\n**Data visualization overview**\n\n- [x] The stile differs from datasets \u0026 visualization overview. Visualizations has all tabs (in progress, active, expired) while datasets has only the one with an entry. How we are doing it with datasets is much better imo.\n- [x] The button view pipeline in visualization has no function. It should have the same style as in the data visualization detail view.\n- [x] The button in view pipeline from dataset overview redirects to the data ops pipeline, but it doesnt reconstruct the pipeline. This works when you enter the dataset detail view. Could you adapt this to work on all cases?\n- [x] Remove the \"Use\" and \"Expires in\" fields from data visualizations.\n- [x] The active icon in visualization is wrong (exclamation mark) compared to checks (see dataset).\n- [x] Remove the pre-fix \"data-visualization/\" of the data visualization name.\n- [x] The username is not clickable.\n- [x] The delete function is not working (no modal to delete the data visualization, as in datasets).\n- [x] We should rename the \"expired\" tab to \"failed\" and \"canceled\". We should rename the \"active\" to \"success\". In both data visualization and dataset view.\n- [x] I noticed that the active data visualization in your repo \"well-megalodon\" has status failed but is in the \"active\" section. This should be then in the new \"failed\" section.\n\n**Data visualization detail view**\n\n- [x] The status should have color (e.g. failed in red, pending in orange, success in green, canceled in red).\n- [x] @andres46 implemented in the experiment view (executive summary) that I could click the \"files selected from path\" (src) whick links to the commit hash view of that path and the branch name, linking to the commit hash view of that branch. He knows more about this but we should include this function in both visualizations and dataset view. Not sure if there is a separate ticket for this, though?\n- [x] The data visualization uses (e.g. t-sne) should be clickable and link to the code repo (in a new tab). This for both data viz and dataset.\n- [x] The abort button is always active, despite the datavisualization being finished. It should be replaced by an X (delete). This deletes the entry and the corresponding branch.\n\n\n### Proposal for Technical Solution\nThe tasks mentioned above should be completed and make the pipelines views bug-free.\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\n- [ ] Few unit tests for the detail and overview components","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-23T09:34:38.947Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T13:15:51.185Z","closed_at":"2020-10-30T13:15:51.097Z","closed_by":{"id":4273308,"username":"andres46","name":"Andres Ausecha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4273308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andres46"},"labels":["bug","feature","frontend","priority::8","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1643928,"iid":30,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Beta 2","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-24T14:06:46.741Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T11:08:24.444Z","due_date":"2020-10-09","start_date":"2020-09-28","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/30"},"assignees":[{"id":4358138,"username":"SaathvikT","name":"SaathvikT","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2848d5e40ea8ae44b744ca51bf84fc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/SaathvikT"}],"author":{"id":4358138,"username":"SaathvikT","name":"SaathvikT","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2848d5e40ea8ae44b744ca51bf84fc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/SaathvikT"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4358138,"username":"SaathvikT","name":"SaathvikT","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2848d5e40ea8ae44b744ca51bf84fc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/SaathvikT"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/853","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":15,"completed_count":14},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/853","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/853/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/853/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#853","relative":"#853","full":"mlreef/mlreef#853"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73028256,"iid":850,"project_id":12894267,"title":"WIP: Follow-up from \"Add routing to all breadcrumb components\"","description":"The following discussion from !891 should be addressed:\n\n- [ ] @diegovinie started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/merge_requests/891#note_431000726):  (+4 comments)\n\n    \u003e Things that are required, are required for good reasons.

So e.g. the frontend build and FE unit tests are only executed if frontend code has been changed.\n\ne.g:\n```\nonly:\n  changes:\n    - web/**/*\n```\n\nCurrently, the end2end tests are located under `web/src/__end2end-tests__` and unfortunately, this means, whenever an end2end test is edited or added we have to wait for the frontend build (and deploy) to be finished.\n\nSo the topic of this ticket is to move the end2end sources out of `web/src/` so that we can use a Gitlab ci build filter on the `web/src` folder.\n\n\n\n### Proposal for Technical Solution\nProposal: Refactor end2end test source to e.g. `web/test/__end2end-tests__` and `web/tests/__unit-tests__` \n\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n=====================\n### Links / references\nFrontend build takes about 18 Minutes\n\n![build](/uploads/4af416ba0e8d57cc77d8524600e8528f/build.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-10-05T15:14:05.736Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T15:27:20.414Z","closed_at":"2021-12-18T15:27:20.400Z","closed_by":{"id":4273308,"username":"andres46","name":"Andres Ausecha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4273308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andres46"},"labels":["frontend","priority::5-medium","technical debt","workflow::ready_4_impl"],"milestone":{"id":920133,"iid":3,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Future Backlog","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2019-07-01T10:35:03.292Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T08:11:44.650Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2022-01-01","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/3"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":4009135,"username":"systemkern","name":"Systemkern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4009135/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/systemkern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/807","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/807","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/807/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/807/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#807","relative":"#807","full":"mlreef/mlreef#807"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":72176176,"iid":804,"project_id":12894267,"title":"Change folder upload to file(s) upload","description":"[MLReef's Glossary](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/-/tree/master/handbook/glossary.md)\n\n### Observed behaviour\n\nThe current function of uploading folders has several issues and need to be adapted to files upload: \n\n- [x] Drag and dropping a file into the drop field results in an error (it does simply not work). \n- [x] When opening the explorer view (by clicking on the drop field), the explorer want to find folders. We need to change this so the explorer searches for files to upload. Selecting multiple files (not only limted to one) should be possible. \n- [x] There seems to be a cap in size to upload of 10MBs in total (sum of all files). This is a limit that is not realistic, as there are no datasets that are below 10MBs. We should have a limit for this of severl GBs (if we need a limit). \n- [x] The root where the user navigated before in the tree view of the repository should be kept for uploading files. So if he moved to cats/train and presses the + button to upload files, the newly uploaded files should be placed there. \n- [x] This root information should also be shown in the upload view (if design is required, please tell). \n- [ ] The drag-drop function removes previous files, review that\n\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nIn staging, try the upload folder function.

Today, and most of the times, a toaster appears with e.g. \"experiment created\" but no entry is found in the experiment overview. This is the same for all other pipelines. \n\nThen, after a while a new toaster appears with pipeline was created and then, the entry is available. \n\nThis time difference results in confusion and bad UX.\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe entry should be created immediately. The pipeline can start afterwards if the machines are not available yet. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn staging, execute any pipeline and jump directly to the results. No entry is there until, if it goes fast, a few seconds but sometimes it takes minutes! \n\n### Solution\nIn order for the backend to create a pipeline in Gitlab, some steps have to be performed\n* [PipelineServiceL209](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/blob/master/backend/mlreef-rest/src/main/kotlin/com/mlreef/rest/feature/pipeline/PipelineService.kt#L209) and following\n\nOne step is to look for or create the EPFBot user. -\u003e Searching is done by select all users from Gitlab and iterating through them. --\u003e `AuthService.CreateOrFindGitlabUser()` --\u003e AuthServiceL263.\n\n`AuthService.CreateOrFindGitlabUser()` is the first place to be changed to a more scalable approach.\n\nWe believe, optimising this function will solve the performance problem.\n\nFirst approach to try out -\u003e https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/search.html#scope-users\n\n\n\n* [ ]  Add at least one test\n\n\n\nAdditional

first stage of the publishing wizard","description":"[MLReef's Glossary](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/-/tree/master/handbook/glossary.md)\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nImplement the user flow of the publishing wizard, the wireframes are ready and HTML elements will be done soon. \n\nUse these elements to create the UI from the \"Select entry point view\" to the interlude. This will be the first stage, it encompasses to provide all the files and data necessary to publish the code project and persist it in the database, call the API's and show the interlude view.\n\nIn the next link, the prototype can be found. For this issue *only* the slides 1-4 are required.\n\n### Proposal for Technical Solution\nThese are the technical requirements for this stage: \n\n* Select entry point:\n\n1. Publish one branch at the time which will be the master branch (protected branch from gitlab) as a starting phase. The commit hash is NECESSARY as well.\n1. The entry point is the file or script to run in python.\n1. The purpose of the publication process is to publish a data operator.\n\nnote: Requirement.txt should be placed in the root, and we try to find it there. Should not be picked by the user, validated in this stage.\n\n* Select base environment:\n\n1. Can only select one environment, only some that are very useful will be as options for the moment.\n1. We need from backend the list of environments available, and an endpoint to send the environment selected(to be called after the publish button is pressed)\n\n* Publish model:\n\n1. Clarify the model type, whether more options should be shown or not.\n1. An endpoint to list the model-types\n1. An endpoint to list ml categories\n1. The model type and ML categories selected should be a field in the backend and included in the publish endpoint\n1. Boolean to persist whether the user accepted the terms of publication, manage versions(probably a timestamp).\n\n\n### Links / references\n\nLink to XD design: https://xd.adobe.com/view/2154ca1c-fbf7-4ba8-bac4-d5edc077d0ac-7407/","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-10T21:14:01.382Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T21:31:24.044Z","closed_at":"2020-10-30T21:27:56.394Z","closed_by":{"id":4273308,"username":"andres46","name":"Andres Ausecha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4273308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andres46"},"labels":["feature_maturity::minimal","frontend","priority::9-very-high","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1643928,"iid":30,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Beta 2","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-24T14:06:46.741Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T11:08:24.444Z","due_date":"2020-10-09","start_date":"2020-09-28","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/30"},"assignees":[{"id":4273308,"username":"andres46","name":"Andres Ausecha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4273308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andres46"}],"author":{"id":4273308,"username":"andres46","name":"Andres Ausecha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4273308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andres46"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4273308,"username":"andres46","name":"Andres Ausecha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4273308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andres46"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/744","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":15,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/744","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/744/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/744/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#744","relative":"#744","full":"mlreef/mlreef#744"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":70969486,"iid":743,"project_id":12894267,"title":"CodeProjectPublishing API and Backend","description":"\n### Problem to solve\n\nThe frontend developers will develop the publishing wizard with the mockups/wireframes.\n\nDuring that development, we might find out the logical point when the frontend wants to send data to the backend (start the wizard) and what information the frontend sends and expects from the backend.\n\nDue to missing planning, we dont know that yet in the backend.

When An existing \"unpublished\" Data Repo is published, the following things will happen\n   - [x] A `Dockerfile` is added to the project\u0026#39;s Git Repo\n   - Does the Dockerfile need to be customized?\n   - [x] A `.mlreef.yml` is added to the Git Repo\n   - does the `.mlreef.yml` has to be customized?\n   - push the docker image as `:latest` version to the docker registry\n   - [x] Gitlab triggers a pipeline based on the `.mlreef.yml` for every commit on the \"master\" branch\n   - [x] this pipeline creates a new version of the Docker image\n   - [x] pipeline is tested in end2end tests? --\u003e based on !806 \n   - [x] the new docker image version is published to Gitabl\u0026#39;s docker registry\n   - [x] parse the python file -\u003e #780 \n   - [x] persist the DataProcessorVersion from the Python file to the database on the first build\n   - [x] update/replace the DataProcessorVersion on future builds (remember every commit to master triggers a new build \n* [x] fetch info or state of tasks/pipelines? -\u003e go directly to GitLab\n* [x] commit/cancel publishing? -\u003e frontend can stop and cancel pipelines\n* [x] stop publishing -\u003e frontend offers to delete the `.mlreef.yml`\n* [x] Publishing Porcess needs to store ./#{#MAIN_SCRIPT}\" --\u003eCORRECTLY \u003c-- in database\n* [x] Create an E2E TEST which tests a custom data operation -\u003e [template e2e test](https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/mlreef/mlreef/tree/master/-/web/src/__end2end-tests__/DataPipelines.test.jsx/); [target

systemTest for Publishing Docker Images to Gitlab/MLReef infrastructure","description":"[MLReef\u0026#39;s Glossary](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/-/tree/master/handbook/glossary.md)\n\n### Problem to solve\nThe most basic part of publishing user-generated Data Processors within MLReef is building and pushing \nDocker Images to MLReef\u0026#39;s Gitlab based Docker Registry.\n\nIt might be necessary to activate or configure the Docker Registry -\u003e https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry.html#enable-the-container-registry\n\nThere exists already a [test project on gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/devops/develop-data-processor) which can be cloned and then pushed to the relevant branch environment or other infrastructure.\n\n### Todo\n\n* call the API codeProject\n* checkout codeProject\n* add some mlreef.yml manually to the project\n* push it\n* test it? \n  * does a pipeline run?\n  * does it succeed?\n  * API call to check docker registry if something is there?\n\n### User experience goal\nMLReef Developers can manually define a Dockerfile and mlreef.yml file to build and push docker images to the MLReef Docker registry.\n\n\n### Proposal for Technical Solution\nThe smallest and simplest possible Dockerfile as a reference to `alpine:latest` without further modifications\n```Dockerfile\nFROM alpine:latest\n```\n\nThe corresponding `.mlreef.yml` would look something like this:\n```yaml\nbuild:\n  image: docker:19.03.5\n  services:\n    - docker:dind\n  script: |\n    echo \"$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\" | docker login \"$CI_REGISTRY\" --username=\"$CI_REGISTRY_USER\" --password-stdin\n    docker build --tag \"$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG\" -f Dockerfile .\n    docker push \"$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG\"\n```\n\nFor more references of how to build docker images with Gitlab\u0026#39;s CI, you can look here\n* https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/blob/develop/web/.gitlab-ci.yml\n* https://gitlab.com/systemkern/s5/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n\n### Permissions and Security\n\n\n### Documentation\nThe implementation of this ticket will yield much clarity about how a future MLReef Dockerfile template has to look like in order to be useful and usable\n\n\n### Availability \u0026 Testing\nThis is a core feature and testing for this has to be completely automated. While writing the testing code, keep in mind that we will support on-premise installations.\n\n\n### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?\nMLReef Developers can build and push docker images to the MLReef Docker registry.\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n=====================\nKeep in mind that, for on-premise installations, we will need to be able to provide our base images preinstalled with the installation.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-26T16:29:14.161Z","updated_at":"2020-10-02T07:58:01.165Z","closed_at":"2020-09-17T13:15:36.661Z","closed_by":{"id":4009135,"username":"systemkern","name":"Systemkern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4009135/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/systemkern"},"labels":["backend","feature_maturity::minimal","priority::9-very-high","spoc::devops","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1625615,"iid":29,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Beta

This involves only the file selector, the Gitlab API request should send the commit id as the ref, and then the user will see everything as it was then.\n\n![image](/uploads/b28361b4c3166878249b933fc345452c/image.png)\n\n### Terminology\n[MLReef's Glossary](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/-/tree/master/handbook/glossary.md)\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n=====================","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-17T08:54:57.687Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T08:25:12.257Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T08:25:12.225Z","closed_by":{"id":3839940,"username":"cpmlreef","name":"cpmlreef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3839940/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cpmlreef"},"labels":["feature_maturity::viable","frontend","invalid","priority::7-high"],"milestone":{"id":2560275,"iid":41,"group_id":5351747,"title":"1.1 Release","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-04-11T08:36:58.590Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T08:22:19.616Z","due_date":"2022-11-30","start_date":"2022-10-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/41"},"assignees":[{"id":3839940,"username":"cpmlreef","name":"cpmlreef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3839940/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cpmlreef"}],"author":{"id":3839940,"username":"cpmlreef","name":"cpmlreef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3839940/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cpmlreef"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3839940,"username":"cpmlreef","name":"cpmlreef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3839940/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cpmlreef"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/689","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/689","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/689/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/689/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#689","relative":"#689","full":"mlreef/mlreef#689"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69748546,"iid":683,"project_id":12894267,"title":"Link data versions in pipelines","description":"### Problem to Solve\nAs a user I want to be able to easily track what version of files I used for any of our pipelines.

reproduce\n* Create and push new branch and for the pipeline to finish\n* Go to the end2end job and look at the log:\n  * Look for the text \"Project URL:\" usually around 1201 and follow the link\n* Look at the project pipelines\n\n\n### Solution\n\u003e Add technical implementation details and the results of the ticket's discussion here.\n\n* [ ]  Add at least one test\n\n\n\nAdditional

Testing on all developer machines","description":"During the implementation of 555 it became clear that backend and to an extend EPF developers need to be able to run automated round trip tests on their developer machines.\n\nCurrently we do not have a really good integration testing concept. Though not the main focus of this ticket, it makes sense to think about a sustainable test concept as well.\n\nSome of the needed tests are:\n* start a model training \n* upload training statistics to the Backend\n* upload trained model results\n* start data pipeline and verify results\n* cancel experiment\n\n\n## Additional Notes\nThere currently exist some bash and curl based tests which could be extended and adapted, but dont seem to run on each machine.\nThere exists also an existing integration test concept, which spins up a gitlab machine and has a clean, reproducible state to run tests. Integration tests can be run on each machine which could start the server, as they rely on docker and kotlin. There are already many integration tests for various reasons which tests different strategies and can be debugged, this concept seems better in terms of maintainability, system architecture and matches the rest of the technology.\n\nOn Linux and OSX these existing curl-bash-scripts tests already work pretty ok but @si-ge-st had problems running them on Windows.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-02T17:26:14.313Z","updated_at":"2020-08-29T17:55:39.129Z","closed_at":"2020-08-17T08:37:00.981Z","closed_by":{"id":3209720,"username":"flohin","name":"Florian Hintermeier","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3209720/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/flohin"},"labels":["backend","feature_maturity::minimal","priority::10-expedite","roadmap::create","spoc::devops","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1390641,"iid":26,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Alpha 10","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-31T11:41:36.531Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T11:58:14.095Z","due_date":"2020-08-14","start_date":"2020-08-03","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/26"},"assignees":[{"id":3209720,"username":"flohin","name":"Florian Hintermeier","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3209720/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/flohin"}],"author":{"id":4009135,"username":"systemkern","name":"Systemkern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4009135/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/systemkern"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3209720,"username":"flohin","name":"Florian Hintermeier","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3209720/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/flohin"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/661","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":15,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/661","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/661/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/661/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#661","relative":"#661","full":"mlreef/mlreef#661"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":69329543,"iid":658,"project_id":12894267,"title":"FE: Set the value of the parameter \"input-path\" with the path from Data selector","description":"### Problem to Solve\n“As a user i will choose the data input using the Data Selector, this path should be the value for the hyperparameter input-path”\n\nSet the value of the hyperparameter called \"input-path\" with the Path from Data Selector. This hyperparameter can be overwritten by simply writing another input path over the \"standard\" value from the data selector.\n\nFor this, we need to: \n- [ ] Limit the number of selections a user can do in the data selector to 1 (either a folder or file)\n- [ ] Redisign the data operators cards to include the automatic input-path from the data selector\n\n### Technical Solution\nProbably, the input-path field needs some automatic updating.

[discussion](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/merge_requests/512#note_364184452):  (+1 comment)\n\n    \u003e Hey @SaathvikT \n    \u003e \n    \u003e I really like this pattern for the routes, do you think we could implement it in the project routes?\n    \u003e \n    \u003e cc: @andres46 \n\nA better pattern for routes handling was found by Saathvik. It makes sense to apply it and refactor the router component in order to improve the readability of that code.\n\nTo apply this pattern in the routes file, an array of objects would probably be better. The object needs a field to indicate that the route is private or not. \n```\n{\"projectName\": { \"isPrivate\": true, pattern: 'my-projects/project-slug/some-sort-of-name/param/:some-param' }}\n```\n\nSo when we want to use it in a component, we can just replace :some-param in the code and use the link from a centrilized source.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-19T15:23:07.607Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T13:30:22.504Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T13:30:22.467Z","closed_by":{"id":4358138,"username":"SaathvikT","name":"SaathvikT","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2848d5e40ea8ae44b744ca51bf84fc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/SaathvikT"},"labels":["feature","frontend","priority::4","technical debt","workflow::ready_4_impl"],"milestone":{"id":920133,"iid":3,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Future Backlog","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2019-07-01T10:35:03.292Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T08:11:44.650Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2022-01-01","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/3"},"assignees":[{"id":4358138,"username":"SaathvikT","name":"SaathvikT","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2848d5e40ea8ae44b744ca51bf84fc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/SaathvikT"}],"author":{"id":4273308,"username":"andres46","name":"Andres Ausecha","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4273308/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/andres46"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4358138,"username":"SaathvikT","name":"SaathvikT","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2848d5e40ea8ae44b744ca51bf84fc?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/SaathvikT"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/588","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":1,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/588","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/588/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/588/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#588","relative":"#588","full":"mlreef/mlreef#588"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":48097907,"iid":583,"project_id":12894267,"title":"Backend: Project owner's uuid is not the same owner uuid","description":"### Observed behaviour\nProject owner's uuid is not the same owner uuid\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\nThey should be the same uuid.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n![image](/uploads/c58f93291596954fb19994323c848aa1/image.png)\nHere look at the **ownerId**\n\n![image](/uploads/fad2fe38c985e503d073017dbb873e51/image.png)\nHere the user's id (in fact uuid) from the `/data-projects/:projectUUID/users` endpoint\n\n\n### Todo\n\n* [ ] add a flyway migration to add some more FKs\n  * e.g., more subject-related FKs\n* [ ] inform *all devs* when this MR is merged instantly\n* *every machine with data inconsistencies will break and crash at beginning!*\n* then we know, which machine has consistency problems and needs to clean its database state (dropping or fixing)\n\nPlease apply that patch LOCALLY:\n\n```\n-- If some strange data exists (Account is owner instead of Subject), this should fix it OR tell you that your database is broken\n-- IF your local database is broken, please clean it.

EPF Bot lifecycle together with group setup","description":"### Problem to Solve\n\nafter mlreef#526 and backend!72 it is necessary to clean up technical debt\nProblem: right now we use the user as GIT_PUSH_USER and GIT_PUSH_TOKEN, which is a security leak.\nWe already have te mechanism to create an \"EPF-Bot\" user, but now this was created for the user's group, and is a Maintainer, which is equally insecure as using the user, and even worse, is not really connected to project.\n\nSo actually we need to solve many problems:\n* when creating a user, a user group must be created. *This group must be used as the owner* for every new project.\n* For every dataproject of this group, a specific EPF-Bot can be created, for example \"mlreef-project-$UUID-$ID-bot\" for a data/code project with UUID $UUID and the connected gitlabId $ID.\n* when a pipeline is started (before the gitlab pipeline call takes place), the following must be ensured:\n  * the project EPF-Bot exists and has a token\n  * that token can be stored as GIT_PUSH_TOKEN for that project (once per project is enough, no need for every CI)\n  * that epf-bot username can be stored as GIT_PUSH_USER for that project \n  * the custom EPF_URL (to update/finish the experiment/pipeline) is created for this distinct PipelineInstance, therefore it shall exist as a pipeline-scoped CI variable and must not exist as a project-scoped CI variable\n\n**Final Notice**: Right now we have the user as the owner of its resources. But actually we need to have the user's group to be the owner, to allow to add the epf-bot as a group member of that project (with DEVELOPER roles, should be sufficient). As a hack, we could add the epf-bot as a free floating user and just assign to that project. Maybe that is even easier, as we dont need the group-\n\n### Technical Solution\n\u003e Add technical implementation details and the results of the ticket's discussion here.\n\n\n### Terminology\n[MLReef's Glossary](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/-/tree/master/handbook/glossary.md)\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n=====================","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-02T18:23:32.454Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T09:16:55.176Z","closed_at":"2020-08-03T09:53:04.837Z","closed_by":{"id":3209720,"username":"flohin","name":"Florian Hintermeier","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3209720/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/flohin"},"labels":["backend","feature_maturity::minimal","priority::7-high","roadmap::build","spoc::devops","technical debt","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1373112,"iid":20,"project_id":12894267,"title":"Alpha 9","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-20T06:16:13.541Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T08:36:21.679Z","due_date":"2020-07-31","start_date":"2020-07-20","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/milestones/20"},"assignees":[{"id":3209720,"username":"flohin","name":"Florian Hintermeier","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3209720/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/flohin"}],"author":{"id":3209720,"username":"flohin","name":"Florian Hintermeier","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3209720/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/flohin"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3209720,"username":"flohin","name":"Florian Hintermeier","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3209720/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/flohin"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/561","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":11,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/561","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/561/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/561/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#561","relative":"#561","full":"mlreef/mlreef#561"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null}]
