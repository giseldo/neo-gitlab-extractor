Reset Password Process","description":"### Problem to Solve\nIn order to allow users to reset their passwords, we have to implement a reset-password process in the backend.\n\n* Upon triggering the process, the User shall receive an email which contains a password reset link which contains some form of a one-time password reset token.\n  * the token can only be used once\n  * the token shall expire after 24 hours\n  * the token shall expire immediately if a new token is issued\n* After following this link they can enter their new password in the frontend.\n* The frontend then sends the password, together with the token to the backend.\n* The backend then:\n  * validates the token \n  * saves the new password\n  * expires the token\n  * performs a login for the user\n  * returns the Session token to the frontend, so the frontend can \"also login\" the user\n\n\nPart of this ticket is also documenting and communicating this process sufficiently with the frontend developer who implements #500 \n\n### Technical Solution\nThe current design requires two backend endpoints.\n1. For the frontend to trigger the process\n2. For the frontend to set the new password\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n=====================\n\u003e Give a more technical explanation of how you want the app to function.

Define Useful DataTypes for Application","description":"### Problem to Solve\n\nCurrently we have just a pile of quick-and-dirty created DataTypes as for a first draft\n\nWe need the some DataTypes, which can be used by EPF, Backend and Frontend.\n\nNow we planned them as single words, but of course we could design them as slug+name,\ne.g. \"image\" and \"Image\" is quite the same for single words.\n\"satellite-data\" and \"Satellite Data\" may differ, but is easy to calculate the relation between slug \u003c-\u003e name\n\n### Technical Solution\n\nData Types suggested\n\nThe data types can be grouped in these classes:\n- Tabular: csv files, numerical, categorical, usually each row represents a sample, each column the features.\n- Time series: csv files in which each row has time information , the rows are ordered usually by time. In this case (medical signals, economic indicators, prices of goods, trajectory of a car...)\n- Images: the images(png,bmp, jpg..) usually come in folders with the class name, or a csv files with images in string form.\n- Voice:  Recordings mp3, wav, usually come in folders with the class name.\n- Video:  Recording  wmv, mp4, mkv, usually come in folders with the class name.\n- Hierarchical (optional it can be considered a subcategory of tabular): Json files that represent data and its hierarchy, usually can be considered as tabular data. for example, positional data, landmarks for face recognition, tags of objects inside an image.. etc.\n\nOutput data types \n- model : model saved as a binary file.\n- All the input datatypes apply here as well.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-07T14:16:45.089Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T15:36:13.132Z","closed_at":"2020-07-06T08:29:33.233Z","closed_by":{"id":4009135,"username":"systemkern","name":"Systemkern","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4009135/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/systemkern"},"labels":["backend","epf","feature","roadmap::share","spoc::devops","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1331723,"iid":25,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Alpha

This is done through the settings / members view. \n\nOnly the \"maintainer\" role can view this page. There are two different types of member invitations, individuals and groups. The main difference is, that when inviting an entire group, all group members get access with a defined maximum permission level. \n\n**Permissions:**\nHow to solve role- **AND** resource-based permissions with spring\n\neg: German is Owner of repo _Cats_ but has only Guest of repo _Dogs_\n\nSimple logic can be implemented in Annotations with `SPEL` complicated logic can be implemented in e.g. Spring's RequestFilterChain or SecurityFilter. Another solution is to use aspect-oriented programming\n\n\n### Technical Solution Backend\n\n\n**Data Access / Caching:**\nToken handling can be handled by caching the JWT tokens / the whole user Blob in Redis\n\n\n### Terminology\n\n*  Searchable members are all MLReef users. They can be within the group or external users. \n*  Inevitable groups can only be sub-groups within the project group. External groups will NOT appear in the search and can not be invited.\n\nAdditional Notes\n=====================\nLink to XD: https://xd.adobe.com/view/06099f51-b2c6-4532-4020-800b4f7e5efa-7038/\n\n![Settings_Overview___2](/uploads/7ba6c330b030e93a9f9aa6830a8f1c26/Settings_Overview___2.png)\n\n![Settings_Overview___1](/uploads/8110f6f2290589ec59882cac342805ad/Settings_Overview___1.png)\n\n![Settings_Overview___3](/uploads/0f5493ff3bf1a39f2a0b66553b22e214/Settings_Overview___3.png)\n\n![Settings_Overview](/uploads/c2be2dd626fa4eac24de28514350eb3c/Settings_Overview.png)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T14:54:36.472Z","updated_at":"2020-06-29T17:34:52.171Z","closed_at":"2020-06-29T17:34:52.105Z","closed_by":{"id":1498214,"username":"diegovinie","name":"Diego Viniegra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1498214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/diegovinie"},"labels":["feature","frontend","missing_backend_task","roadmap::manage","workflow::doing"],"milestone":{"id":1308598,"iid":20,"group_id":5351747,"title":"Alpha 6","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-02T12:57:30.931Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T09:12:36.152Z","due_date":"2020-06-19","start_date":"2020-06-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/mlreef/-/milestones/20"},"assignees":[{"id":1498214,"username":"diegovinie","name":"Diego Viniegra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1498214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/diegovinie"},{"id":5223032,"username":"si-ge-st","name":"German Sidorenko","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5223032/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/si-ge-st"}],"author":{"id":3839940,"username":"cpmlreef","name":"cpmlreef","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3839940/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cpmlreef"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":1498214,"username":"diegovinie","name":"Diego Viniegra","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/1498214/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/diegovinie"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/389","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":12,"blocking_issues_count":2,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/389","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/389/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267/issues/389/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/12894267","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#389","relative":"#389","full":"mlreef/mlreef#389"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32136636,"iid":387,"project_id":12894267,"title":"Frontend: Use MLReef-Backend for Experiments","description":"### Problem to Solve\n\nThe frontend has to use the Backend endpoints for Experiment manipulation\n\nThere are the following here: https://mlreef.gitlab.io/backend/feature/265-refactor-experiments/#_get_data_projects\n\n```\nExperiments - /data-projects/:id/experiments\nGET …​/experiments\nGET …​/experiments/:id\nPOST …​/experiments # create new one, update is not supported\nGET …​/experiments/:id/metrics\nPUT …​/experiments/:id/metrics  # just useful when called by EPF!\nGET …​/experiments/:id/mlreef-file\nPOST …​/experiments/:id/start  # starts the execution of this Experiment\n```\n\n### Technical Solution\n\n* [x]  Create a DataProject (https://mlreef.gitlab.io/backend/feature/265-refactor-experiments/#_post_data_projects)\n* [x]  Use that DataProject to get the ID and the gitlab Project\n* [x]  Create Experiment via that REST call\n* [x]  Get the MLReef file (for debug purposes?
