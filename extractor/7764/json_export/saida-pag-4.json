After looking at the initial numbers, the amount of additional time taken by the additional cache push/pull (~18500 files in `node_modules`, about ~8 seconds to push and ~8 seconds to pull) would eat up most of the gains caused by eliminating the `yarn install` (which takes ~20 seconds).  This seems to indicate that the Yarn/NPM network download time is normally very fast (probably due to CDN/etc, and yarn optimizations), almost as fast as downloading and unzipping the files from disk.  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/6358 still offers opportunities to do this caching via docker, though.\n\nWe currently don't put the downloaded node_modules in the cache, like we do for the bundler vendor directory containing gems.  This would probably be an easy and quick win to save 20-30 seconds, and also reduce the possibility of flaky builds (if the download happens to fail for network/etc issues - I'm not sure if we are using a local pass-through caching proxy or not)\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Small, probably 20-30 seconds for jobs which need this.\n\nPROS:\n* Easy to implement, low risk, same as we are already doing
