the problem validation or breakdown phase. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. --\u003e\n\n### Problem to solve\n\nGitlab users want to easily find/read release notes relevant to them, such as tier, the stages they use or specific items of interest (upgrades, deprecations and removals) in release announcements. Gitlab team members (such as Marketing and Sales) want to successfully find/share relevant release notes with Gitlab users and prospects. \n\nThe following pages deliver Gitlab's release notes organized in various ways, forcing internal and external Gitlab users to reference various pages to collect the information they seek:\n\n- **Release Post Marketing Blog\"**: https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/06/22/gitlab-13-1-released/\n- **Gitlab Releases\"** https://about.gitlab.com/releases/ archived ==\u003e https://web.archive.org/web/20200714130736/https://about.gitlab.com/releases/\n- **GitLab upcoming releases\"** https://about.gitlab.com/upcoming-releases/\n- **Upcoming features for paid tiers\"** https://about.gitlab.com/direction/paid_tiers/\n- **X-Y Preview\"** https://about.gitlab.com/releases/gitlab-com/\n- **Gitlab releases\"** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v12.10.0-ee\n\n### Intended users\n\nCurrent users, prospects, internal Gitlab team members\n\n### Proposal\n\nImprove and leverage Gitlab's in product Release feature https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases to serve as the \"go to\" SSOT for both SaaS and Self-hosted release notes, such that it can essentially replace the need for the various pages listed above.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Deliver a better user release notes experience internally/externally\n- Boost process efficiency by decoupling the requirements of \"release notes\" from a \"marketing blog post\"\n- Enable Product team to focus on feature/supporting content success \n- Enable Marketing to focus on how, when and where else to best expose the release notes as part\n- Enable Sales to clearly communicate via one thorough/sortable SSOT for existing and potential customers\n\n**Requirements:**\n\nTo successfully replace the various release pages listed above, the Release feature https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases needs to:\n\n|   | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Display or provide quick access to content blocks that currently only surface in the [Release Post Marketing Blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/06/22/gitlab-13-1-released/) | -

What are the goals?\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease specify which goal is the primary goal.\nExamples:\n* (Primary) Increase self-hosted conversion rate.\n* Users can't find what they're looking for.\n* It's difficult to sign up.\n* This feature is confusing.\n* This template is difficult to update.\n* Reduce cognitive overload.\n* Improve time-on-site.\n--\u003e\n\nThe lifecycle stage headings on [/features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/) (`\u003ca class=\"item-link\" ... \u003ch2\u003e` plus maybe `\u003cp class=\"subhead\"\u003e ...`) can be a long distance apart from where one views the page. This necessitates a lot of scrolling up (often too far, therefore down again) to find the stage name.\n\n#### Who is the audience?\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease specify which audience is the primary audience.\nExamples:\n* (Primary) Potential event attendees.\n* Speakers\n* Media\n* Potential sponsors\n--\u003e\n\n* GitLab employees looking up the feature-to-stage assignment, for example to then find out a DRI, stable support counterpart or technical writer on [/company/team/org-chart](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/org-chart/) or [/handbook/product/categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages).\n\n#### What are the measurable key performance indicators (KPI)?\n\nSee examples in `checklist of deliverables` below.\n\n#### Please identify the directly responsible individual (DRI), stakeholders, and roles\n\n\u003c!--\nWho should we be asking for questions and reviews?\nExample in a markdown table:\n\n|Name|Role|\n|------|------|\n| `@user1` | DRI |\n| `@user2` | Conversion |\n| `@user3` | Design |\n| `@user4` | Metrics |\n\netc\n--\u003e\n\n#### What are the project must-haves?\n\nThe `\u003ch2\u003e` stage header must remain in view while scrolling.\n\n#### What are the project should-haves?\n\nMaybe pinned to the to the top of its respective `\u003cdiv class=\"features-description`, below `\u003cheader class=\"navbar\"`.\n\n\u003c!--\nThese are important but not necessary for delivery in the current timebox. These are often not as time-critical and may be delayed until a later milestone.\n\n(Example should-haves)\n* New look \u0026 feel\n* Improved navigation\n* Updated hero section\n--\u003e\n\n#### What are the project could-haves?\n\nInstead of pin to top, maybe to the side, tilted by 90˚?\n\n\u003c!--\nThese are desirable but not necessary.\n\n(Example could-haves)\n* Sliders\n* Animations\n* \"Bells-and-whistles\"\n--\u003e\n\n#### What are the project wont-haves?\n\n\u003c!--\nThese are not planned at this time.\n\n(Example wont-haves)\n* A certain section of the page is currently performing well or functioning as intended. Do not change it.\n* A requested feature is too expensive and not currently a good way to spend limited resources.\n* A requested feature is impossible given current constraints and existing technology.\n--\u003e\n\n#### Where do you expect traffic to come from?\n\n\u003c!--\nExamples:\n* Linked from https://about.gitlab.com/example/\n* Social media campaign\n* Targeted ads\n--\u003e\n\n#### Please provide any related media files\n\n\u003c!--\nIf you are requesting that we place images, videos, etc on a page, please either attach the files to the issue or tell us where they can be sourced:\n* What subject matter of imagery or videos are you looking for?\n    * Examples: Stock photo of a young person using a phone, screenshot of application name during stage/interaction/screen X, abstract tech background...\n* The @username of who has related files, what issue they're in, or where they can be found.\n* For logos, please upload vector files such as svg if possible. If vector files are not possible, please upload transparent png.\n* If linking a word/spreadsheet/presentation document with images included, please also provide links to the original image sources.\n* Please note that the more media we have to spend time sourcing, re-sizing, and touching up, the less time we have to work on other items. Media is important but don't forget to weigh its implementation costs.\n--\u003e\n\n#### Will you need an opengraph image for social sharing?\n\n\u003c!--\nYes or no, and what could it look like?\n--\u003e\n\n#### If applicable, please provide some example webpages for design guidance.\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease specify why you like each reference.\nExamples:\n* Pinterest implements

A landing page that we can send people to for display and selection of virtual workshops. The actual workshops will be on separately created Marketo landing pages.\n\n#### If applicable, do you have any user journeys, wireframes, prototypes, content/data?\n\nThe last time we did something similar was for the 2019 Roadshow https://about.gitlab.com/events/roadshow-2019/\n\n**MVC:**\n\n1. Add an agenda table in place of the speaker section (right side column). \u003c-- `Currently the only item remaining on the request!` This is MVC because the page is text heavy and needs something (image, table) to break it up.\n2. Clone the 2019 Roadshow page, rephrase to virtual devops workshops. (jenny did this in the MR)\n3. Create a new data/event_virtual_devops_workshop.yml file to populate the data. (brandon did this)\n\n**Ideally:**\n\n1. The event selection at the bottom of the page will be on one line across the screen (to prevent scrolling) instead of vertical.\n2. Remove the speaker section from this page. (jenny did this in the MR)\n3. Add a \"who should attend\" section. (jenny did this in the MR)\n4. Implementing the functionality to automatically pull relevant events onto this page when the individual pages are created. (brandon did this)\n\n\n**Long term:** Brandon recommends we adapt the new event template created recently in the following issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/6294, remove irrelevant sections, and add a new component for listing the virtual workshops.\n\n#### What is the primary purpose of this page/flow?\n\nGenerate registrations for virtual workshops\n\n#### What are the KPI (Key Performance Indicators)\n\nRegistration counts\n\n#### What information is this page/flow trying to convey?\n\n* Existence of virtual workshops\n* Agenda\n* Who should attend\n\n### Who is the primary audience? Be specific.\n\n* [x] Potential Prospects who have never heard about GitLab\n* [x] Prospects we're currently selling to\n* [ ] Non-paying customers\n* [x] Paying customers\n* [ ] Authorized resellers\n* [ ] Community members\n\nThis workshop is designed for IT Professionals:\n\n* Actively evaluating GitLab for their organization\n* Driving innovation by knowing the full scope of the GitLab tool chain\n* Planning to increase operations\n\n#### Any other audiences?\n\nNo\n\n#### Where do you expect traffic to come from?\n\nMarketing emails to database, sales-invited\n\n#### Does this page/flow require any forms\n\nYes. @jennyt will assist in providing the relevant registration form.  Registration form will be on the individual landing pages for each event.  \n\n#### Is there a due date? If so, why?\n\nPlease note that issues with a short deadline and no listed reasons are difficult to prioritize.\n\n**2020-03-27**, reasons unknown, deadline already passed.\n\nReason for deadline: The time to set-up and promote a webcast or virtual event is a minimum of 45 days. This event was provided to the MPM team after this deadline. We are able to promote and fill the event, but we require the landing page as quickly as possible. Once the single page is set up with the functionality to pull the individual registration page links, we will not need to repeat this work.\n\n\u003c!-- These labels will be automatically applied unless you edit or delete the following section --\u003e","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-30T17:00:46.056Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T16:25:41.611Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T16:25:41.587Z","closed_by":{"id":3955006,"username":"jennyt","name":"Jenny Tiemann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3955006/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jennyt"},"labels":["mktg-inbound","mktg-status::wip","mktg-website","template::web-new"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":3955006,"username":"jennyt","name":"Jenny Tiemann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3955006/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jennyt"}],"author":{"id":4342398,"username":"brandon_lyon","name":"Brandon Lyon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4342398/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brandon_lyon"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3955006,"username":"jennyt","name":"Jenny Tiemann","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3955006/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jennyt"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/6985","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":6,"completed_count":3},"weight":5,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/6985","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/6985/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/6985/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6985","relative":"#6985","full":"gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com#6985"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":32352147,"iid":6911,"project_id":7764,"title":"Update \u0026 to and in location factor targets","description":"This repository primarily relates to the logged out marketing website\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/ \nand company handbook\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ \nThis is not the repository for requests related to docs.gitlab.com, product, or other parts of GitLab.\n\n## Issues should identify The Five W's\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws\nwho, what, when, where, and why.\n\nWe also recommended MoSCoW sorting\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method \nthings the issue Must, Should, Could, and Won't do.\n\n* Please apply appropriate labels or your issue may not be sorted into appropriate boards.\n* Please select a template from the top left menu before continuing.\n\nNote there is a blank template\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/new?issuable_template=blank-template\npre-populated with labels and @ mentions.\n\nIf you do not select an appropriate template then your issue might get lost.

AB test to valuedriver","description":"This issue is a followup for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/6595\n\n## Relevant URL\n\n* https://about.gitlab.com/just-commit/reduce-cycle-time/\n\n## AB testing LaunchDarkly documentation\n\n* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_XztSRs_CMBulZDvrVbSHmCjtOnL0xd6gFUEVo_NxoA/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Results of prior test found in\n\n* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate-marketing/issues/1596#note_299047010\n\n## Requested deliverables\n\n* Switch the main nav so it doesn't have the free-trial CTA (free trial is distracting).\n    * The thank you popup after submit could have free-trial as secondary CTA.\n    * Make sure there is only one CTA.\n        * Remove the \"ready to talk\" section at the bottom of the page.\n* Change the download CTA phrase from \"Read the Whitepaper\" to \"Get your Whitepaper\".\n    * Suggested copy: any action word that doesn't sound like work (ie not \"read\")\n* Try different report screenshots or potentially animations, have a more graphical cover.\n    * Ask Luke for suggestions, we could create a cover, perhaps some synergy of the graphic with the CTA button.\n* Try moving the bullet points into the purple section before the CTA button (what you will learn is important).\n* Change the popup title to match the button (Get your whitepaper).\n* Bump up the font size of and adjust copy to \"trusted by 100,000+ organizations worldwide\" and make it bigger.\n* Check with @ mnguyen4 to ensure copy is consistent with what interested them in the first place.\n\n## Valuedriver reference material\n\n* https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1adRX6Vua7LhpZNgG6scqn4uH8Mz3rDVhNGBUU8RFZ2o/edit#slide=id.g7e88ccd42e_0_57\n\n## Notes:\n\n* Please do not run this test for too long so we don't use up our allocated MAU (monthly active users). Last time we ended up with ~ 2000 hits (1,000 each) in ~ 5 days for this particular page which should suffice.\n* Shane Rice suggested removing the form from the popup and leaving it on the page. That's a good suggestion but for efficiency \u0026 time sensitivity I would suggest that as a followup and doing this first.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-04T20:15:55.950Z","updated_at":"2020-06-29T17:54:08.002Z","closed_at":"2020-06-29T17:54:07.971Z","closed_by":{"id":4342398,"username":"brandon_lyon","name":"Brandon Lyon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4342398/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brandon_lyon"},"labels":["OKR","mktg-inbound","mktg-status::wip","mktg-website","template::web-none"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4555518,"username":"laurenbarker","name":"Lauren Barker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4555518/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/laurenbarker"}],"author":{"id":4342398,"username":"brandon_lyon","name":"Brandon Lyon","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4342398/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/brandon_lyon"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4555518,"username":"laurenbarker","name":"Lauren Barker","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4555518/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/laurenbarker"},"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/6770","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":4,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/6770","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/6770/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/6770/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#6770","relative":"#6770","full":"gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com#6770"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":242,"epic":{"id":17135,"iid":242,"title":"Tactical Conversion MVCs","url":"/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/242","group_id":6543,"human_readable_end_date":"Jul 31, 2020","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":31349309,"iid":6714,"project_id":7764,"title":"Unfiltered posts with \"featured\" appearing on /blog","description":"Before the new /blog design, posts in the `unfiltered` category did not appear on /blog.
