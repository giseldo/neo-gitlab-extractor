We used GitLab's [iteration value](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration), along with GitLab's tool to [promote an issue to an epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#promote-an-issue-to-an-epic) to iterate on an issue we realized was too large in scope by [promoting it to the blog post template epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/-/epics/296). Once we did this, we were able to also [collaborate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration) more effectively. I'd like to highlight how GitLab's iteration and collaboration values are embodied by the GitLab product's technical capabilities.\n1. We had a problem where existing CSS was conflicting with the Slippers design system, and since we didn't have the header/footer ready yet, we couldn't just disable them all. So we used the [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to encapsulate CSS entirely, along with [templates and slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots) to write semantic HTML in erb or HAML templates as desired, all tied together with [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements). In addition to the values piece, I'd like to showcase how we used Web Components to solve challenges in a way that allowed us to iterate quickly. We have lots of the content [written as documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/0c3b195ee49d4283fcb8330f987b3c039d0f2cff/doc/slippers-blog-template.md#L22), which could be rewritten in an approachable way for the blog.\n\n## Roles and Responsibilities \n| Person | Role |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| `@tywilliams` | requestor | \n| `@person`| editor |\n| `@person` | approver (optional) | \n\n### Checklist\n\n- [ ] If you have a specific publish date in mind (please allow 3 weeks' lead time)\n  - [ ] Include it in the issue title and apply the appropriate marketing milestone (e.g. `Mktg: 2021-03-28`)\n  - [ ] Give the issue a due date of a minimum of 2 working days prior\n  - [ ] If your post is likely to be \u003e2,000 words, give a due date of a minimum of 4 working days prior\n- [ ] If [time sensitive](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/#process-for-time-sensitive-posts)\n  - [ ] Add ~\"Blog: Priority\" label and supplied rationale in description\n- [ ] If wide-spread customer impacting or sensitive, mention `@nwoods` to give her a heads up ASAP, apply the ~\"sensitive\" label, and check the [PR handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#requests-for-announcements) in case you need to open an announcement request instead of a blog post issue\n- [ ] If the post is about one of GitLab's Technology Partners, including integration partners, mention `@dpduncan`,  apply the ~\"Partner Marketing\" label, and see the [blog handbook for more on third-party posts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/index.html#third-party-posts)\n- [ ] If the post is about one of GitLab's customers, mention `@FionaOKeeffe`, apply the ~\"Customer Reference Program\" label, and see the [blog handbook for more on third-party posts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/index.html#third-party-posts)\n- [ ] Indicate if supporting an event or campaign\n- [ ] Indicate if this post requires additional approval from internal or external parties before publishing (please provide details in a comment)\n\n## Production \n- [x] Requestor to complete issue template (Triage, Proposal, Roles and Responsibilities, Checklist )\n- [ ] Issue sent through triage for consideration (approve, backlog, deny) \n- [ ] Issue assigned to requestor to draft blog post and open MR\n- [ ] MR created and linked to issue - issue is now deprecated in favor of MR and will close once MR is complete","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-03-29T21:52:44.837Z","updated_at":"2021-05-03T22:56:25.084Z","closed_at":"2021-05-03T22:56:24.616Z","closed_by":{"id":3914078,"username":"skassabian","name":"Sara Kassabian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3914078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/skassabian"},"labels":["Blog::Planned","IM-Support","blog post","mktg-content","mktg-inbound","mktg-status::plan"],"milestone":{"id":1839236,"iid":401,"group_id":6543,"title":"Mktg: 2021-05-09","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-20T21:46:11.668Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:03:39.771Z","due_date":"2021-05-09","start_date":"2021-04-26","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones/401"},"assignees":[{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"}],"author":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":7737712,"username":"tywilliams","name":"Tyler Williams","state":"blocked","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7737712/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/tywilliams"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2021-04-29","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/11178","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":22,"completed_count":2},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/11178","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/11178/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/11178/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#11178","relative":"#11178","full":"gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com#11178"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":81517837,"iid":11155,"project_id":7764,"title":"How can we shift accessibility left?

look like. \n\n## Roles and Responsibilities \n| Person | Role |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| `@person` | requestor | \n| `@person`| editor |\n| `@person` | approver (optional) | \n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x]

Unless you are just suggesting a blog post idea, you will need to create the formatted merge request for your blog post in order for it to be reviewed and published. --\u003e\n\n## Triage (REQUIRED)\n\nThe Inbound Marketing team prioritizes requests that drive results and meet our [goals of generating organic traffic and inquiries](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#goals). \n\nPlease note that there is a different process for when you want to announce something via the blog. Please see [announcement requests](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#requests-for-announcements) in the handbook and open an announcement request issue instead of a blog post issue. \n\nGenerally speaking, engineering blog posts that are tutorials/how-tos or which share how we built or debugged something, are popular with our audience. **If your proposed blog post is aligned with our [Attributes of a successful blog post guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/#attributes-of-a-successful-blog-post), you can skip straight to your [proposal](#proposal).** \n\nIf you are pitching something outside of those guidelines, please fill in the below to help us prioritize. You can check out [examples of high- and low-performing blog posts to help with your rationale](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/content/editorial-team/#top-performing-blog-posts). \n\n**This issue fulfills one of these goals:** \u003c!--(Requestor check one)--\u003e\n- [x] Drive traffic to our website\n- [ ] Convert traffic into leads\n- [x] Thought leadership/share expertise\n- [ ] Build relationships with potential customers\n- [ ] Drive long-term results (please explain below in your proposal)\n- [ ] Announcement \n  - `Link to announcement request issue (required, see https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#requests-for-announcements)`\n- [ ] Cross-functional support \n   - `Link to OKR (required if this box is checked)` \n   \n## Proposal\n\nI'd like to explore how accessibility in software development relates to the open source community. Open source software is designed so everyone can contribute (and ideally, use) software, and accessibility in software development is about building and designing software to be inclusive to users of differing abilities. \n\n## Roles and Responsibilities \n| Person | Role |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| `@person` | requestor | \n| `@person`| editor |\n| `@person` | approver (optional) | \n\n### Checklist\n\n- [ ] If you have a specific publish date in mind (please allow 3 weeks' lead time)\n  -

https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/764878/MTTP-KPI-Dashboard?widget=10055732 to only count working days within a month to give a true measure of MTTP.\n\n\u003e@davis_townsend do you think we

Unless you are just suggesting a blog post idea, you will need to create the formatted merge request for your blog post in order for it to be reviewed and published. --\u003e\n\n### Proposal\n\nPart of our [engineering + remote work series/collection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/growth-marketing/global-content/editorial/-/issues/57#note_444393598), how we do agile and sprints remotely. Will add any relevant videos to the issue in description/comments.\n\n### Questions for respondents \n\n* How does GitLab (the platform) enable teams to work more agilely? ([Here is a blog post we published on the topic](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/03/05/gitlab-for-agile-software-development/), but I'd like to know your perspective as well)\n* How does your team specifically use sprints at GitLab?\n* Do you have experience working with Agile for software development while working in an office setting, at a previous company?\n* Do you feel that GitLab's structure as an all-remote async company makes it easier for programmers to work agilely? Why or why not?\n* Thinking specifically about Agile/sprints, what are some of the benefits of working in an office setting, with your colleagues next to you? What are some of the challenges?\n* Are there any major differences between conducting a sprint/Agile software development on an in-person team vs. an all-remote, asynchronous team?\n* What are some tools, strategies that are most useful for remote, Agile software development? Any links/resources I should include in this post?\n* What advice do you have for engineers that are adopting Agile for the first time, or are working remotely for the first time?\n* What else do I need to know but haven't asked?\n\n### Some relevant links: \n- https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/11/11/gitlab-for-agile-portfolio-planning-project-management/\n- https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/03/05/gitlab-for-agile-software-development/\n- \"[A Day in the Life of an Agilist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J0bonGoECs)\"\n- Keynote from Virtual Commit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8BvRMalbkM\u0026list=PLFGfElNsQthYQaTiUPQcu4O0O20WHZksz\u0026index=10\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] If you have a specific publish date in mind (please allow 3 weeks' lead time)\n  -

Should I say migrating from Jeknins or migrating to GitLab CI and then mentioning Jenkins in the subtitle?\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] If you have a specific publish date in mind (please allow 3 weeks' lead time)\n  - [x] Include it in the issue title and apply the appropriate milestone (e.g. `Blogs October 2020`)\n  - [x] Give the issue a due date of a minimum of 2 working days prior\n  - [ ] If your post is likely to be \u003e2,000 words, give a due date of a minimum of 4 working days prior\n- [ ] If [time sensitive](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/#process-for-time-sensitive-posts)\n  - [ ] Add ~\"Blog: Priority\" label and supplied rationale in description\n  - [ ] Mention `@rebecca` to give her a heads up ASAP\n- [ ] If wide-spread customer impacting or sensitive, mention `@nwoods` to give her a heads up ASAP, apply the ~\"sensitive\" label, and check the [PR handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#requests-for-announcements) in case you need to open an announcement request instead of a blog post issue\n- [ ] If the post is about one of GitLab's Technology Partners, including integration partners, mention `@TinaS`,  apply the ~\"Partner Marketing\" label, and see the [blog handbook for more on third-party posts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/index.html#third-party-posts)\n- [ ] If the post is about one of GitLab's customers, mention `@KimLock` and `@FionaOKeeffe`, apply the ~\"Customer Reference Program\" label, and see the [blog handbook for more on third-party posts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/index.html#third-party-posts)\n- [x] Indicate if supporting an event or campaign - Jenkins campaign\n- [ ] Indicate if this post requires additional approval from internal or external parties before publishing (please provide details in a comment)","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-02T19:08:57.258Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T11:33:45.653Z","closed_at":"2020-12-08T17:40:14.842Z","closed_by":{"id":3914078,"username":"skassabian","name":"Sara Kassabian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3914078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/skassabian"},"labels":["Blog::Scheduled","IM-Support","blog post"],"milestone":{"id":1603027,"iid":61,"project_id":7764,"title":"Blogs December 2020","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-25T15:47:09.222Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T17:07:51.541Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2020-12-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/milestones/61"},"assignees":[{"id":3914078,"username":"skassabian","name":"Sara Kassabian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3914078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/skassabian"}],"author":{"id":3553841,"username":"cbuchanan","name":"Chrissie Buchanan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3553841/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/cbuchanan"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":3914078,"username":"skassabian","name":"Sara Kassabian","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3914078/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/skassabian"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":"2020-12-04","confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/9569","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":12,"completed_count":4},"weight":1,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/9569","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/9569/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764/issues/9569/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7764","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#9569","relative":"#9569","full":"gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com#9569"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":73628489,"iid":9546,"project_id":7764,"title":"Collection: remote work + engineering - 2021-03-12","description":"\u003c!-- PLEASE READ: See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/ for details on the blog process.

However some marketing pages look like Handbook pages and it is confusing users why they can't use the static site editor.\n\nAn example of this is with the Direction page (https://about.gitlab.com/direction/)\n\nOne approach to solving this problem is moving the content to the Handbook.
