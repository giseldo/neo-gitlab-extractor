This is easy and handy if I know the\nnomenclature for a SPICE voltage source.\n\nThen if I open the Spice Model Editor dialog I can see my 1V, 1kHz sine\nwave. Using the dialog I then change the frequency to \"10k\" and save. This\nadds a Spice_Model=\"ac 1 sin(0 1 10k)\" property to the voltage source.\n\nNow, the interesting part happens: the Spice_Model property wins and I get\na 10kHz sine wave. But the old VALUE property looks like I should have a\n1kHz sine wave. While it's understandable what's happening in hindsight,\nthe UI certainly does look confusing.\n\nThere may be a way to force the parameters to be in sync or alert the user\nif the format of the VALUE field looks like a SPICE source and the\nparameters don't match the Spice_Model property value.

This is not good.\n\nExample of that is this thread:\nhttps://forum.kicad.info/t/custom-power-pin-names/3960\n\nIt may be something dumb but, to many people, including me, it is good to\nhave the Power Symbol with a custom name.\n\nAlso, the Kicad library has many power symbols where the differences\nbetween them are only the symbol name.\n\nSo, my question is:\n\nWhy I can't change the name/label of the Power Symbol? What is the reason\nbehind that?\n\nThe libraries could have only a few different symbols where the difference\nis the shape of the symbol instead of its name and the user will be able to\nsplit the power net just renaming the power symbol.\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-08T18:18:56.470Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T18:02:03.469Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T18:02:03.430Z","closed_by":{"id":9328354,"username":"mikebwilliams","name":"Mike Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9328354/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikebwilliams"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":{"id":2759717,"iid":19,"group_id":6593371,"title":"8.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-09-01T14:43:30.061Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T03:31:24.174Z","due_date":"2024-09-20","start_date":"2023-01-31","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/kicad/-/milestones/19"},"assignees":[{"id":4725252,"username":"stambaughw","name":"Wayne Stambaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4725252/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stambaughw"},{"id":9328354,"username":"mikebwilliams","name":"Mike Williams","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/9328354/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/mikebwilliams"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4725252,"username":"stambaughw","name":"Wayne Stambaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4725252/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stambaughw"},"user_notes_count":22,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":14,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2203","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":34,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2203","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2203/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2203/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2203","relative":"#2203","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2203"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":38,"epic":{"id":214414,"iid":38,"title":"Library Management","url":"/groups/kicad/code/-/epics/38","group_id":6593436},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27879482,"iid":1236,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Pins placement in library editor  (lp:#1786068)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1786068) created by **Leandro Heck (leoheck)**\n```\nOpening a project from the internet.

(I am using KiCad 6.0.0-rc1.)  See\nthe attached screenshot.\n\nThat behavior makes sense, I'm sure, in many use cases.  In my particular\napplication, though, I am converting historical schematics into KiCad for\npublic presentation, and trying to reproduce the appearance of the original\ndrawings as closely as is feasible.  These historical drawings do not\ndisplay the pin names sideways as KiCad does, and therefore I would prefer\nto have the option to display the pin names in an upright orientation.\n\nIt would be helpful if the same behavior were available for the pin names\nas for the reference designators: i.e., if there were an option in the\nsymbol-library editor to define the orientations of the pin names on a pin-\nby-pin basis.  Or, alternatively, if in eeschema itself, it were possible\nto move and rotate the individual pin names after the component had been\nplaced on the schematic.  (Though for my purposes, doing it in the symbol-\nlibrary editor would be better.)\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema wishlist","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-08T02:07:01.555Z","updated_at":"2022-04-23T18:46:56.396Z","closed_at":"2022-04-23T18:46:56.382Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["eeschema","feature-request","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed","symbol-editor"],"milestone":{"id":2417087,"iid":12,"group_id":6593371,"title":"7.0","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-13T23:36:06.140Z","updated_at":"2023-02-11T16:45:34.812Z","due_date":"2023-02-14","start_date":"2021-12-26","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2202","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2202","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2202/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2202/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2202","relative":"#2202","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2202"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27882093,"iid":1430,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Cant save footprint on footprint editor.

(Tools -\u003e Annotate schematic...) was opened in\nEeschema, it is always visible in the window preview of Eeschema. I can\nreproduce it like this on Win10-64 (version info below):\n\n1. Open the schematic editor.\n2. Open the annotation window and close it again.\n3. Go to pcbnew\n4. Move the mouse to Kicad-icon in the taskbar (don't click) and wait for\nthe popups of main window, Pcbnew and Eeschema.\n5. Move the mouse to the Eeschema-popup and the annotation window will be\nvisible.\n6. Clicking on Eeschema will make the annotation window disappear.\n\nAs I sometimes just want to have a quick look at my schematic during\nlayouting this behaviour is quite disturbing. Workaround is to close\nEeschema and then not opening the annotation window again but maybe it\ncould be fixed anyway.\n\n\nVersion info:\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (6.0.0-rc1-dev-205-gc0615c5ef),

If the image is something else, such as\n72 dpi, it will be scaled wrong on the display.  At least that's true in\nLinux Mint, with KiCad 4 and 5.\n\nI think the only workaround right now to get the image to display properly\nis to physically rescale it (either internally in the schematic editor or\nexternally in a program like GIMP or Photoshop) to 300 dpi.  But in my\napplication a 300 dpi image is far too large in terms of memory for KiCad\nto load it at all, regardless of well it might be scaled if it managed to\nload.\n\nA specific case in which I have this problem is an E-size drawing into\nwhich I want to load an E-size background JPG.\n```\nOriginal tags:

outline in high contrast mode (lp:#1784686)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1784686) created by **Robert (robee)**\n```\nHigh contrast mode (HCM) is wonderful to work in, but the one problem I\nfind is that the body outlines of parts are too easy to ignore, and I\nsometimes put part edges over each other.  Since Kicad doesn't really do\nsingle layer views very easily, I would imagine the normal way people place\nparts on the board is in HCM. I think HCM would be even better if the body\noutlines were highlighted more than the background, but less than the\ncopper.  So when working on an external layer, the body outlines of parts\non that layer could be 10% to 20% (or less, would need experimentation)\nbrighter than the other layers.  Because the outlines would still be dim,\nthis wouldn't take away from the benefits of HCM.

To\nme, this implied it was doing the exact same process I had already done and\nthat was not something I wished to repeat.\n\n2) You cannot exit the first time run popup to change projects.

the\nfolder ~/.kicad_plugin\n\n - open pcbnew\n\n - refresh external plugins\n\n -\u003e crash\n\nI am using (installed via reynauds ppa):\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion:
