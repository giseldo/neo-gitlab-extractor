I instantiate this sheet\nmultiple times on a root sheet, with multiple unique sheet names, but a\nshared underlying schematic file.\n\nWhen I annotate this root sheet, each sub-sheet gets specific component\ndesignations, which is correct.  Changes to the underlying sheet propagate\nto all instances of the shared 'children' as expected.  However changing\nthe component value also changes it in all instances, which isn't correct.\n\nFor example, if I create a simple RC low-pass filter as a shared schematic\nsheet, with a single resistor and capacitor, and instantiate it twice with\nhierarchical sheets in a root schematic, then use the annotate tool to\nassign component designations, I see it assigns R1/C1 to the first\ninstance, R2/C2 to the second instance, etc.\n\nWhen I assign PCB footprints, I can assign individual footprints to each of\nthese components, even though each RC pair belongs to the same 'logical\nschematic'.  When I generate a netlist for pcbnew, I see each individual\ninstance of R1, R2, C1, and C2.  Looking at the .sch file in a text editor\nit appears that eeschema 'collapses' the hierarchy into the root schematic\nas I would expect.\n\nMy current workaround it to assign a value of \"FIXME\" for the part values\nthat are different, then assign all footprints in the footprint assignment\ntool, then generate a netlist for pcbnew.  After this, I manually edit the\n.net file, and replace the \"FIXME\" text using a text editor to the real\nvalues that I intent to use in the layout for each individual component,\nwhich appears to work properly, although it is a pain because I have to go\nthrough this process every time I make a change and forward annotate\nthrough to the pcbnew layout program.\n\nWhy can't each component have a unique tuple of name, value, and footprint,\ngiven the schematic file representation appears to support this already (at\nleast for names and footprints)?\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-07T20:45:30.257Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T22:17:50.228Z","closed_at":"2019-12-28T16:42:54.922Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3404","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":18,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3404","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3404/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3404/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2466"},"references":{"short":"#3404","relative":"#3404","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3404"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27924339,"iid":2353,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Add origin color/thickness control in modedit (lp:#1819047)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1819047) created by **Seth Hillbrand (sethh)**\n```\nFootprint editor shows the origin as thin, dark blue lines.

In other words, if an\nerrant jump occurs, it always jumps to a much smaller X or Y coordinate.\n\nBy a \"large\" amount, I mean (for example) that if I happen to be working at\nthe right edge of the sheet, it may jump nearly to the left edge, or indeed\neven beyond the left edge so that it's outside of the sheet altogether.\n\nI have been dealing with this particular problem for many months, but have\nbeen unable to characterize exactly when this happens.

I will note, however, that I typically use a\ngrid size of 25 mils rather than the default 50, and sometimes use a grid\nsize of 5 mils for a very small bit of editing, and that the jumps\nsubjectively occur more frequently if zoomed in a lot at a small grid size.\nAt any rate, whether it's objectively more frequent then or not, it's the\ntime when it's most annoying, because it's the most time-consuming to try\nto find the patch you were working on before it happened, so it definitely\nstands out the most in my memory.\n\nVersion info:\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.0-rc2-unknown-4612175~81~ubuntu16.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.47.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2g zlib/1.2.11 libidn/1.32 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.4.0-53-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.58.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.47.0\n    Compiler: GCC 5.4.0 with C++ ABI 1009\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T15:08:33.029Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:24:29.197Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T21:55:49.139Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::low","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085268,"iid":4,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.5","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.5/+download/kicad-5.1.5.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.5/+download/kicad-5.1.5.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T14:16:20.660Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:31:01.418Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/4"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/292","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/292","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/292/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/292/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#292","relative":"#292","full":"kicad/code/kicad#292"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27933742,"iid":2928,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Field Name Templates settings do not respect default text size (lp:#1818668)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1818668) created by **Ron Burkey (rburkey)**\n```\nIn the eeschema preferences, it's possible to set a default text size.\nIt's also possible to use the Field Name Templates settings to define\nfields which will always be added to components placed on the schematic.\nHowever, these Field Name Templates do not respect the default text size\nsetting.

It used to be that each press of\nan arrow key would move the item by exactly one grid position.\n\nThat is no longer the case, and hasn't been so for perhaps 6-8 months.\nWhat happens now is that pressing an arrow key makes the item jump by a\nvery large amount.  (I can't quite characterize how much it jumps, since\nit's not always the same, and seems to depend on the zoom level.  But it\nmay be about 10% of the viewport size.)\n\nNow, unfortunately, if you want to move an item by a small amount, you have\nto try and judge it precisely with the mouse, which is very

They each have their specific\npurposes. There are many benefits to implementing a dedicated app within\nkicad for simulation including an entirely separate hotkey menu (suggesting\nimplementing LTSPICE R, L, C hotkeys for resistor, inductor and capacitor),\nkeeping various iterations of prototype circuits which are not intended for\nproduction in the same project directory, avoids annotation issues,\nseparates and permits users to make multiple board layouts by transferring\nonly the needed circuits or circuit blocks from simulation app to drafting\napp (eeschema) after verifying their operation from within the simulation\napp. The alternative currently is the user must keep separate files for\nboth drafting (eeschema) and simulation as eeschema files which can cause\nissues if the user is actually using kicad for simulating and verifying\ncircuit operation.

The video is generally painful\nand annoying to watch, but if I saw something that seemed worthy and I\ncouldn't find it in the bugtracker already I thought I should add a new bug\nfor it.\n\nAbout 1:58 into the video Dave is asking for a quick way to check the board\nstats. Dimensions, number of components, etc. I don't know that this is\navailable, but it made me think of some kind of summary dialog. Some items\nthat could be included which pop into my head just now:\nBoard size\nNumber of Cu layers\nComponent count\nNets\nNets routed\nUnconnected items\nZones\nKeepout zones\nDRC errors\nLast saved user name\nTotal editing time\n\nSome of them could be grouped together.
