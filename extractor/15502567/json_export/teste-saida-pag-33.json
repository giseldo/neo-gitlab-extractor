suppose this is only a rather minor annoyance, but I just noticed it and\nit does seem a bit of an oversight. In eeschema, one can change the colors\nused to render the schematic, including setting the background black. This\nis nice, as some people find the black background easier on the eyes.\nProblem is, if you set a black background, you have to set light-colored\ngraphic elements, and this carries through to plot exports (PS, PDF, etc)\nwhen color is enabled. These all have light backgrounds, meaning these\nelements are now almost invisible.\n\nI'd think that the plots should either ignore the UI color settings, or\nhave their own separate

See the GIMP for\nexample.\n\nThe problem.\nMaster documentation is written in OO. Suppose that some volunteer (like\nme) is avid to translate it into a foreign language. Suppose that starting\nfrom a specific version copy, working night and day, in a fiew months he\n(me) is able to complete it. It wold be already obsolete because of the\nimprovement and new functions applied meanwhile in the master developmente\nbranch. Documentation, if you want to be ready when the development version\nbecome stable, must be translated along with the development process.\nSuppose you want to update. You (me) have to read all the master copy along\nwith the translated copy do see where the document is changed and how. This\nwork is many times more the translation effort in itself. If the situation\ndo not change this could be a very discouraging factor for translators.\n\nThe solution.\nThe aforementioned GIMP translation team use xml2po to face up to this\nproblem, another (better) tool is Publican\n(https://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/en-\nUS/Publican/4.0/html/Users_Guide/index.html) but I think that there are\nmany more different tools out there.\n\nA transition to the XML format will have the (benign) side effect to enable\ncontext sensitive help, as is in GIMP, much appreciated by the users.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2014-08-08T14:50:58.225Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T22:32:23.936Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T22:32:23.899Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad

Trying to\nmove those, will result in an popup telling you it's a locked part (which\nis fine).\nIf one tries to move those parts via the hotkey, imho, nothing should\nhappen (actual result: the mentioned popup, slowing down the workflow).\nIf there's more then one part under the cursor, the \"Selection\nClarification\" dialogue pops up (also ok), but locked items are selectable\nto move (which will result in the first mentioned popup).\n\nAn easy option to avoid selecting items which are locked, is to disable\nthose entries in the list.\nSadly it's not possible to get any information inside the\nPCB_BASE_FRAME::PcbGeneralLocateAndDisplay ( int aHotKeyCode ) method\n(passing any argument to it will result in a segfault, also there's not a\nsingle place in the code, passing anything to it).\nThe main problem with the attached (ugly) quickfix to disable the locked\nentries is, you cannot tell what kind of action called the function (move,\nrotate and flip are forbidden for locked parts, but editing the properties\nfor the part is ok - so one can disable the lock again).\n\nThe patch disables the \"first level access\" to the part, but selecting a\npad from the part and then choosing the part from the pads menu still\nworks. I don't really recommend using the patch ;).\n\nAlso it would be nice to number the entries inside the selection\nclarification menu (or all the other menus you can trigger with hotkeys)\nand assign some kind of context sensitive  hotkeys, to access the right\nentry (like pressing '1' for the first entry and so on).\n\nVersion:\ntesting, 3762.\n```\nOriginal tags: lock move part pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2012-10-13T04:45:33.132Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:53:46.500Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T12:31:34.023Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::low","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2880","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":40,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2880","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2880/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2880/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2880","relative":"#2880","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2880"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27921655,"iid":1966,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Project manager multiple selection options (lp:#1016464)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1016464) created by **szymon (szymon123)**\n```\nSeen under windows.

it seem to be random.\n\nfor example if i choose:\n- reset existing annotation\n- sort components by X (top to bottom, left to right)\n- start to (sheet number)*100 and use first free number\n\ni expect that components annotation is like\n\n100  400  700 1000\n200  500  800 1100\n300  600  900 1200\n\nbut what i get is something like:\n\n1300 1000  200  400\n1200  800   300  700\n1100  900

It has a super function called 'snap-to'.  Very\nsimply, it is a hotkey that moves the cursor to the centre of the nearest\nobject, whether that be a track end, a component pad, a line end, or\nwhatever.\n\nOnce you press the hotkey, the mouse cannot move the cursor for 2 seconds.\nThis gives you enough time to place whatever you want to place at that\npoint.\n\nThis feature also provides an easy way to place something to be an exact\nspace away from something else using the keyboard.  So if you want two\ntracks spearated by exactly 2mm, then you snap to one end of the first\ntrack, then use your keyboard to move the cursor exactly 2mm to the right\nand hotkey-place the second track.  Very accurate and easy.  (Mind you,\nCircad also had a nice feature which let you move 10x and 100x grid spacing\nwith the cursor keys by pressing Shift \u0026 Ctrl while arrowing -- that was\nhandy, too).\n\nAn example of when this snap-to is needed.  Trying to place a 2:1 rectangle\non the PCB_Edges layer.  I can start in top left corner, place a line to\nthe bottom, then a line to the right, then back up to the top, but how do I\nknow how far up to the top to go so that I'll meet the original starting\npoint exactly?  Use snap-to.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2011-07-06T00:30:22.707Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T08:09:28.358Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T08:09:28.315Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::fix-released"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1096","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":62,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1096","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1096/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1096/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1096","relative":"#1096","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1096"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27940594,"iid":3369,"project_id":15502567,"title":"wishlist: Hotkey for all functions (lp:#806259)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/806259) created by **Berwyn Hoyt (berwyn)**\n```\nIt would be most helpful if we could assign a hotkey to every toolbar\nfunction in KiCad.
