As identification of all symbols in a\nproject now are associated with library names, the renaming of rescued\nsymbols by appending \"-RESCUE-ProjectName\" to the symbol name seems\nredundant. It clutters things up as one now has full identification of\nrescued symbols like: \"ProjectName-rescue:OriginalSymbolName-RESCUE-\nProjectName\". With the reservation that I am not familiar with KiCads inner\nworkings, it seems that it should now be adequate to keep the original\nsymbol name and use \"ProjectName-rescue:OriginalSymbolName\" for\nidentification of rescued symbols.\n\nBefore sym-lib-table introduction, the symbol renaming was needed to\ndistinguish the rescued symbol from a modified version, but now it seems\nredundant, and by retaining the original symbol name, the result of the\nrescue operation would be closer to the result of a manual rescue where the\ncache lib was simply copied and renamed to be referenced as a local\nlibrary. [Also as I understand from a discussion that followed the\nremapping blog post announcement on the forum, rescue operation is now only\nsupposed to be activated if a symbol is missing, not modified].\n\n(I am using latest Windows nightly, 2018-01-07 revision 47989ccfc).\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-01-07T13:48:23.072Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T00:09:45.651Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T00:09:45.579Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::low","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1087157,"iid":12,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.0.0-rc2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-03T06:48:31.614Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:32:07.740Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":4725252,"username":"stambaughw","name":"Wayne Stambaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4725252/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stambaughw"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4725252,"username":"stambaughw","name":"Wayne Stambaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4725252/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stambaughw"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1685","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1685","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1685/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1685/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1685","relative":"#1685","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1685"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27922435,"iid":2095,"project_id":15502567,"title":"texture support for 3d model (lp:#1741688)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1741688) created by **Jan-Åke Larsson (jalar)**\n```\nI have just made a 3d model of a VU meter we are using, in freecad.

The problem\nis that the duplicate and paste commands do not let the user give the\nsymbol a name. The new name is simply prevname_0 (or _1, _2, whatever).\n\nAlso: those duplicate/cut/copy/paste commands are all right-click context\nmenu commands in the library editor. Shouldn't they be accessible from the\nmain Edit menu? Perhaps with standard ctrl-X, ctrl-C, ctrl-V keyboard\nshortcuts?\n\nTo add rename functionality: many applications use the notion of selecting\na thing in a menu, and when it's highlighted, that thing can be edited.\nThis can be one way to rename the symbol, as you would select and highlight\nthe symbol name in the list and just type in the new, and done.\n\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion:

The icon in this button changes so subtly\nthat it’s not at all obvious that it changes! However, the tooltip for this\nbutton changes correctly. That is, when the ratsnest is visible, the\ntooltip reads “hide board ratsnest,” and when the ratsnest is invisible, it\nreads “show board ratsnest.” This is good — the tooltip should show what\nwill happen if you press the button. Also, toggling this button toggles the\ncheckmark in the ratsnest visibility option in the render thing. This too\nis good.\n\nIn the visibility window render tab, toggling the Ratsnest checkbox toggles\nthe whole board ratsnest, as expected. When the checkbox is off, the\nratsnest is gone; when on, the ratsnest appears. Also, the LHS toolbar\nboard ratsnest button changes tooltip and (very subtly) its icon\nappropriately. So far so good.\n\n(However, the tooltip for the visibility checkbox always says “show\nunconnected nets as a ratsnest,” so it explains the feature, but doesn’t\nexplain the effect of the checkbox toggle. The layer options in the\nvisibility area are different: the checkboxes all have tooltips that say\n“enable this for visibility” and the items themselves have tooltips that\nare descriptive. This is an inconsistency, not really a bug.)\n\nNow the really useful feature, the “local ratsnest.” It seems to work when\nit wants! Toggling it when the board ratsnest is enabled has no effect. The\nwhole board ratsnest remains visible, the tooltip does not change from\n“Display local ratsnest” and its icon very subtly changes until you either\nclick on something or hit M with the cursor over a footprint, at which\npoint it reverts to its previous state.\n\nAfter some experimentation, it seems as if the only way to enable local\nratsnest display is to toggle the ratsnest visibility to off, so all\nratsnest lines vanish, then hover the mouse over a footprint and hit “M,\"\nat which time the nets connected to that footprint will appear and move as\nyou move the part. The ratsnest doesn’t appear when you click on a part to\nselect it, you must hit “M.” BUT — this does not hold true for the LHS\nBoard Ratsnest button, that is, if you turn board ratsnest off with that\nbutton and select and move a part, no local ratsnest is displayed. Thus the\nvisibility checkbox and the LHS toolbar button are not redundant.\n\nIf in that mode, you place the part (left-mouse-button click), the ratsnest\nlines vanish, and press the LHS Board Ratsnest button, the whole board\nratsnest does not appear until you select or move a footprint. But, if you\ntoggle the ratsnest visibility checkbox, the board ratsnest appears\nimmediately.\n\nFinally, it is clear that the RHS Local Ratsnest toolbar button does\nabsolutely nothing.\n\nMy guess is that the logic should work the following way:\n\na) LHS ratnest button should toggle ratsnest on and off, with its icon\nstate showing the current state and make it obvious.\nb) RHS local ratsnest button should toggle between board and local ratsnest\nc) Eliminate render tab visibility option for ratsnest entirely.\n\nI understand that c) is where the ratsnest color may be changed, and if the\nuser changes the background color to white, then white ratsnest lines\nbecome invisible. So perhaps the way this all should work is:\n\na) Eliminate LHS ratsnest toolbar button entirely.\nb) Toggle ratsnest visibility with the checkbox in the render tab.\nc) RHS ratsnest button toggles between board and local ratnest button. (And\nits tooltip should change with the state.)\n\nI know this is somewhat long-winded but local ratnest display is really\nimportant when you’re working on a crowded board.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (2017-12-24 revision 5708665)-master, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.0.20 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.0\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 17.3.0 x86_64), 64 bit, Little endian, wxMac\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (UTF-8,STL containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.61.0\n    Curl: 7.43.0\n    Compiler: Clang 7.3.0 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=ON\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-12-26T17:30:56.740Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T00:14:47.658Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T21:21:03.778Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::low","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/233","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":14,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/233","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/233/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/233/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#233","relative":"#233","full":"kicad/code/kicad#233"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27875372,"iid":842,"project_id":15502567,"title":"different block operation behavour between applications (lp:#1740138)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1740138) created by **Sergey A.

As a\nlibrary maintainer I'm using customized environment variable to make KiCAD\nuse libs that I checked out somewhere on my system.\n\nI set them using the KiCAD menu entry \"Preferences | Configure Paths\". They\npoint to checkouts of the KiCAD libs that I made below D:\\KiCAD. I.e.\n${KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR} = \"D:\\KiCAD\\kicad-symbols\", see attached screenshot\n\nNow I'm doing the following:\n1. Start KiCAD, with the last project I used (sometimes I'm using a local\nsym-lib-table sometimes not, the global sym-lib-table is emotied, The sym-\nlib-table always references using environment vars, e.g.\n\"${KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR}/Amplifier_Buffer.lib\")\n2. Opening the library editor, I see a full list of all libs in\n3. Now I see a list of all the libs that are currently referenced by the\ncurrently used sym-lib-table, but when I try to open the libs in the\n\"Search Tree\" the nodes are empty, i.e. the libs do not expand and show NO\nentries. This is true for all libs that not part of the default libs\ninstalled with the nightly (remember I'm a lib maintainer, so I'm working\nwith cutting-edge versions and PRs that cannot yet be part of the nightly\npackage). I can though expand libraries that are part of the standard\ninstallation and then see the contents in the installed libraries, NOT in\nthe downloaded.\n4. Now I go to the KiCAD main screen, click on \"Preferences | Configure\nPaths\", click OK and reopen the library editor. After it reloads the libs,\nI can now expand a lib and its contents from the checkout is shown.\n\nTo me this looks like KiCAD does not use the values for the environment\nvariables set in its dialog \"Preferences | Configure Paths\", but only after\nthe dialog has been opened. Until then it seems KiCAD uses the system\nenvironment variable, as it was generated during Install, which points to\nthe installed libs.\n\nThis behaviour is a bit unexpected ... True, I can easily fix it by setting\nthe system environment variables, but since I CAN set them in KiCAD, I\nwould expect KiCAD to use these right away.\n\nBTW: Would it be possible to set these environment variable on a per-\nproject basis? That would be great for library review (I could have a\nproject for libs in state 1 and another projet for libs in state 2 ... but\nI also see that that's maybe a special request that not many people will\nprofit from ;-)\n\nWould be great to see this fixed. Unfortunately I currently don't have\nenough time to look into the code myself and propose a patch :-(\n\nPS: To all that do celebrate it: Merry christmas!\n```\nOriginal tags:

This option could be just 4 values like\n0,0.25,0.75,1 so to be able to specify the transparency of the 3D model\n(from invisible=0, to completely opaque=1).\nThis feature would be very useful for mechanical design involving for\nexamples enclosures.\nIt could be implemented just adding only when opacity value is less than 1\nan optional parameters to the footprint file format.\nThis would break back compatibility but ONLY if transparency is applied\n(opacity less than 1).\nThen there would no need to change all the footprint libraries, but it\nwould add a valuable feature to pcbnew

They\nshould be identical as far as I believe the intended behavior should be.\n\nThanks for your time guys!\n\n\nApplication: pcbnew\nVersion: no-vcs-found-a655486~61~ubuntu17.10.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n    libcurl/7.55.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2g zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.2 libpsl/0.18.0\n(+libidn2/2.0.2) librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.13.0-16-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.3 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.62.0\n    Curl: 7.55.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.2.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: 3d-viewer raytrace","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-11-17T20:46:29.959Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T22:02:51.047Z","closed_at":"2020-04-22T23:00:16.924Z","closed_by":{"id":3451304,"username":"burhanemre","name":"Emery Burhan","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4e6ab66b12e2791ed9e76cd9ba422031?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/burhanemre"},"labels":["3d-viewer","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2083","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":18,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2083","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2083/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2083/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2083","relative":"#2083","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2083"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27935432,"iid":3085,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Allow thermal relief options for custom pads (lp:#1732720)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1732720) created by **James Jackson (james-a-f-jackson-2)**\n```\nWhen creating a footprint with a custom pad shape, copper fills do not\nrecognise the net assigned to the pad, and therefore the copper fill does\nnot reach the pad.\n\nMinimal example attached - one custom footprint with one regular pad and\none custom pad, each assigned to the same net.

the Design Rule Check should not change the layout of your board.\nCurrently, as part of running the Pcbnew's DRC, the filled areas are\nrecalculated.\nIf, due to some previous routing, there are overlaps with filled areas, it\ncan lead to the situation displayed in the attached project.\nHere, one trace overlaps a filled area.\nNow, when running the DRC, this overlap is removed by recalculating the\nfilled areas.\nHowever, the DRC doesn't mention this in any way, so one can easily\nbelieve, that the design prior to executing the DRC was correct (and thus\nleads to ordering wrong layouts…).\n\nIn my opinion this is a user interface bug. I understand, that it might be\nnecessary to recalculate the filled areas during the DRC. However, *if*\nthis leads to changes, it should be clearly presented to the user. Maybe\nsomething similar to the way in which the user gets asked, if the\nannotations should be automatically updated, when she tries to export a\nnetlist and some parts are not annotated.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 4.0.5+dfsg1-4 release build\nwxWidgets: Version 3.0.2 (debug,wchar_t,compiler with C++ ABI 1010,GCC\n6.3.0,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\nPlatform:

Imagine that you are designing your PCB. You\nend it, DRC check it and take a well-deserved pause.\nSome time later, you come back and make some pretty small arrangements in\nthe layout to make it cleaner (You just push/drag/shove a track) and leave\nit for today.\n\nThe next day, you produce the Gerber files, send them and... Oh surprise !\nSome tracks were fused with the ground plane... Happy track-cutting time :D\n\nThe problem is the use of the \"Don't show filled area in zones\" which is\ndamn convenient but allow some serious mistakes.\n\nI think that a pop-up like \"Would you like to recalculate the zone filling\nbefore generating Gerber ?\" or best :\n\"Warning, you got some tracks mixed up with some filling zones\". could save\nsome lives...\nor even running a DRC check before the generation (with, maybe) an option\nto disable that in the general options\n\nThanks,\nJulien FAUCHER\n```\nOriginal tags: drc export gui

This is not intuitive, and it does not seem right. This is a bug, plain\nand simple.\n\nSteps to reproduce bug:\nopen KiCad\nTools -\u003e Run Page Layout Editor (Ctrl + Y)\ndelete all of the features of the page (right click on rect1, press the 'D'\nkey; right click on rect2, press the 'D' key; right click on segm1, press\nthe 'D' key; ...)\nOnce you have deleted them all, the page will return to the default state\n(all of the features of the page will spontaneously return!!) But in the\nleft-hand window, none of the features are displayed at first: picture for\nproof:\nright before I delete the last part of the page: http://prntscr.com/fvgo23\n(attachment 1)\nright after  I delete the last part of the page: http://prntscr.com/fvgo7l\n(attachment 2)\n\nNow, if I right click on \"\u003cdefault\u003e\" and select \"Add line\":\nhttp://prntscr.com/fvgoks (attachment 3)\nAll the features show up on the left-hand pane again:\nhttp://prntscr.com/fvgopo (attachment 4)\n\nWhat I think should happen is this: when I delete all the features of the\npage, they STAY GONE. They should not reappear for no reason.\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my bug report  :)\n\nCheers!\nJensen\n\n\nApplication: pl_editor\nVersion: 4.0.6 release build\nwxWidgets: Version 3.0.2 (debug,wchar_t,compiler with C++ ABI 1010,GCC\n6.3.0,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBoost version: 1.60.0\nCurl version: libcurl/7.52.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2k zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0\nnghttp2/1.19.0 librtmp/2.3\n         USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n         USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n         USE_FP_LIB_TABLE=HARD_CODED_ON\n         BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n\n\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 4.0.6 release build\nwxWidgets: Version 3.0.2 (debug,wchar_t,compiler with C++ ABI 1010,GCC\n6.3.0,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBoost version: 1.60.0\nCurl version: libcurl/7.52.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2k zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0\nnghttp2/1.19.0 librtmp/2.3\n         USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n         USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n         USE_FP_LIB_TABLE=HARD_CODED_ON\n         BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-07-14T02:07:50.867Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:54:04.717Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T14:54:04.461Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3303","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3303","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3303/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3303/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3303","relative":"#3303","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3303"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27922300,"iid":2068,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema: add distinction between \"internally not connected\" and \"do not connect\" pins (lp:#1703908)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1703908) created by **Timur Kristóf (venemo)**\n```\nSome components have pins that are \"internally not connected\", meaning that\nyou are free to connect whatever you want.

Create new layout in Pcbnew.\n2. Add housings TQFP32 7x7mm 0.8mm pitch footprint from the standard\nlibrary.\n3. Rotate footprint by 45degrees\n4. Set soldermask clearance to 0.05mm and minimum width to 0.15mm.\n5. Plot to gerber.\n6. Open the solder mask layer in gerber viewer.\n\nActual result: Several pads will have been joined in the soldermask layer.\nExpected result: No pads are joined in the solder mask layer.\n\nI believe that the issue is caused by a missing epsilon value when\ncomputing the soldermask on a rotated component. It so happens that the\nfootprint has 0.55mm wide pads and 0.8mm pitch, if you add it up with the\nclearance and minimum width you get: 0.8mm === 0.55mm + 2*0.05mm + 0.15mm\nand I believe that it's a truncation error in the floating point math used\nto compute the final solder mask.\n\nFor now I'm working around it by using 0.0499999 solder mask clearance.\n```\nOriginal tags:
