This can easily lead to a much more expensive design\nthan intended, or even one physically impossible to manufacture.\n\nThe board setup dialog should include configuration for sequential\nlamination / HDI drill stackups, where the user can set the allowed drill\ndiameters separately for each drillable layer pair.\n\nIf the user requests a blind/buried via between two layers which cannot be\ncreated using the available drill stackups, KiCAD should pop up a message\nexplaining that this is not a valid blind via for the current stackup, and\nasking if they want to create a through-board via instead.\n\nBlind/buried vias between layers which are a subset of the allowed drills\nshould be extended as needed. For example, if the user has configured blind\nvias from layer 1 to 4, and requests a blind via from layer 1-2, this\nshould be extended to a 1-4 blind via.

done?\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-26T19:39:23.625Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T09:10:51.372Z","closed_at":"2021-07-01T09:10:48.774Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff

Continue to add next pad\n---Observe: auto increment Not working properly, next pad number increments\nto '6' instead of 'A1'\n\nCompares to \"Legacy Toolset\", next pad increments to 'A1'.\n\n(Please see attached JPEG screenshot for another example.)\n```\nOriginal tags: missing-gal-tool pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-26T17:14:04.813Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T22:01:00.848Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T22:01:00.816Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["fp-editor","priority::low","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1231394,"iid":2,"group_id":6593371,"title":"5.1.7","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-04-08T12:06:05.149Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T20:04:47.218Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2020-04-08","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/kicad/-/milestones/2"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1882","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1882","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1882/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1882/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1882","relative":"#1882","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1882"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27933778,"iid":2934,"project_id":15502567,"title":"pcbnew writer outputs Layer names as symbols rather than strings (lp:#1821776)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1821776) created by **Seth Hillbrand (sethh)**\n```\nWhile we do not support S-Expr pairs in our file format, the current output\nof layer names prevents the use of canonical S-Expr parsers that do.

issue: graphic line \"auto merge\" in eeschema (lp:#1821728)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1821728) created by **Dino Ghilardi (dino-ghilardi)**\n```\nProblem: when you align two consecutive joint lines they are merged into a\nsingle line even if the line style is different.\n\nReproducing the issue: In eeschema draw a first horizontal line, dashed.\nEdit the line and change the line style to \"solid\"\nDraw a new line starting from one of the external points of the old line.\nIf you draw it horizontal, eeschema joins the line with the old one, using\nonly one of the settings for the line style, so, for instance, you cannot\ncontinue a solid line with a dashed segment if they are aligned.\n\nThe same problem arises if you edit a line moving an initial-final point:\nwhen it is aligned with an old segment it is joined also when line\nattributes are different.\n\nPossible solution: do not join two lines in a single one if the line\nattributes are different.\n\nThe same behaviour can be seen for other attributes as the color of the\nline.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nkicad version (version information from

Also applies to\nDwgs.User layer and maybe other layers.\n\nEdge cuts lines can still be selected individually with right click, but if\nco-sited with another line such as one on Dwgs.User layer it is very hard\nto select the (now) 0 width line. Turning off the Dwgs.user layer was the\nonly way to grab the line.\n\nWhen it is selected by using block command, message is provided \"Line width\ncannot be 0\". It can now be set to any required value, but changing in the\nEdit tab / Edit Text \u0026 Graphic Properties again to try to set all edge.cuts\nto (say) 0.05mm still sets it back to width 0.\n\nAs I could not get the change size to work I eventually settled for setting\nthe graphic default to .05mm and re-drawing the outline as a work around,\nand that is fine as long as the setting remains as started.\n\nThe graphics setting tab is not covered in the supplied PCBnew\nDocumentation as far as I can discover.\n\nBuild details:\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0)-1, release

which will then highlight any pads on the board\nthat have no net (because the footprint has pads that are not linked up to\nsymbol pins).\n\nThis probably isn't quite the right behavior.

gotten a cry for help regarding a strangely behaving project over\nat the forum: https://forum.kicad.info/t/before-giving-up-on-kicad-one-\nlast-attempt-erc-misery/15933\n\nWe played around with it but are out of ideas.\n\nIt seems something is quite wrong with the schematic as it is. I will\nattach the original version and one that i cleaned up and assigned\nfootprints such that one can also check what gets exported.\n\nOne strange thing is that ERC reports R13 as not connected (exporting to\npcb_new will also leave R13 unconnected)\nEven stranger are the crystal near R13, and its condensators. These are not\nreported as not connected but do not get a connection on the board if\nexported.\nIf i delete the wires between r13 and the crystal i can no longer highlight\nthe remaining wire connecting the crystal to its capacitors.\n\nA similar behavior exists with the net created by the global labels Rx, Tx,\nand Reset. (Here replacing the ardoino with some other symbol can fix the\nproblem. But the one with the crystal persists.)\n\nThis behavior is experienced with multiple versions of kicad (At least\n5.0.2 and 5.1.0 expirience this problem)\nI seem to remember encountering something similar on the forum a long time\nago but can no longer find the post. (Meaning something very similar could\nhave already been reported here.)\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-23T20:26:53.051Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:23:19.037Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T17:32:30.852Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085254,"iid":2,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.1","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.1/+download/kicad-5.1.1.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.1/+download/kicad-5.1.1.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T14:05:30.747Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:29:34.439Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/2"},"assignees":[{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/158","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/158","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/158/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/158/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#158","relative":"#158","full":"kicad/code/kicad#158"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27924463,"iid":2370,"project_id":15502567,"title":"ngspice: enable .dc current, temperature and resistance sweeps (lp:#1821460)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1821460) created by **Holger Vogt (h+vogt)**\n```\nThis is an extension to report\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1786126\n\nThe .dc command in ngspice (in addition to sweeping a voltage) allows\nsweeping the current of a current source that is in the netlist, the\ntemperature of the simulation or sweeping the value of a resistor that is\nin the netlist.\n\nThe command for sweeping the temperature is\n.dc TEMP -15 75 5\nDuring simulation a scale (x axis) vector temp-sweep is generated, which is\nused for plotting.\n\nCombining the temperature sweep with another sweep is possible, e.g.\n.dc V1 0 5 0.1 TEMP -15 75 5\nHere for each temperature the voltage V1 is swept. vector temp-sweep is not\ngenerated, but vector v-sweep.\n\n.dc TEMP -15 75 0.5 V2 0 5 1\nFor each voltage  V2 the temperature is swept. vector temp-sweep is\ngenerated and has to be available for plotting.\n\nThe command for a resistance sweep in combination with a voltage sweep is\n.dc R2 5 10 1 V1 0 1 100m\nThe scale vector res-sweep is generated and used as x axis vector for\nplotting\n\nThe command for a current sweep in combination with a resistance sweep is\n.dc I1 0 1 100m R2 5 10 1\nThe scale vector i-sweep is generated and used as x axis vector for\nplotting\n\nEeschema --\u003e Tools --\u003e Simulator --\u003e Settings --\u003e DC Transfer\nshould be modified, e.g. by exclusive radio buttons V, I, T, R, each for\nprimary and secondary selection, next to the enable button.

import: symbol with multiple pads mapped to single \"not connected\" pin creates stacked pins in kicad -\u003e get connected in kicad but not eagle. (lp:#1821319)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1821319) created by **John Turner (whinis)**\n```\nI noticed this behavior as I imported some of my libraries and schematics\nfrom eagle but later reproduced on my own. I have several footprints that\nhave multiple not connected pins/pads all mapping to a single not connected\npin on the symbol. On import KiCad imports these all as a stack of pins set\nto not connected and set to invisible, however due to all the pins being\nstacked they are all assigned to a net. This means that in Pcbnew the\nrouter wants me to connect my not connected pins. I could not originally\nlocate why this behavior was happening until I came across a reddit thread\nwhere someone else had this issue and it appears this is intended behavior\nand the \"correct\" way to deal with it is to spread the not connected pins\naround your symbol outline. The problem with this approach is there are\nmultiple RF and specialized ICs where a 40 pin package might have 20 or\nmore not connected pins although I am not sure the technical reasons for\nsuch setups.\n\nIf you are attempting to create compact symbols this has the issue that you\nneed a relatively large blank space to \"store\" your not connected hidden\npins. I would like to propose that if pins are set to not connected they\nare ignored by the KiCad routing algorithm stacked or not.\n```\nOriginal tags: eagle

the function was called “Show module ratsnest”, and its\ncommand button was in the left toolbar right below “Show board ratsnest”.\nThis behaviour, IMHO the correct one, is also described in the pcbnew\nmanual at chapter 7 \"Footprint placement\" (Para 7.1 and 7.2).\nThe command button however has disappeared without apparent reason.\n\nIn version 5.0.2 of pcbnew, when moving a component, its ratsnest was\n(always) shown.\n\nIn version 5.1.0 (see below for exact info) the ratsnest is no longer shown\n(which I think is  very inconvenient).\n\nA workaround (albeit an impractical one) would be to use the “Display local\nratsnest” command button in the right toolbar, but it would require an\nannoying sequence of operations (go to button / click, go to component /\nclick, “m”, move, position, go to button / click, click elsewhere) in order\nto achieve the same result.\n\nAll builds used are Windows release builds from the KiCAD website.\n\nApplication: pcbnew\nVersion: (5.1.0)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: feature.request pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-21T13:49:14.103Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T20:00:08.635Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T13:52:31.691Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["feature-request","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":12,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3133","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":46,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3133","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3133/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3133/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3133","relative":"#3133","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3133"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27924443,"iid":2367,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Grid dropdown doesn't show y increment for non-symmetric grids  (lp:#1821166)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1821166) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nWhen User Grid is selected in the grid selection dropdown the text is in\nformat \"n.nnnn mm (n.nn mils)\".

Perhaps the below concept doesn't affect the general KiCad users,\nor affects them less than me, so keep that in mind.\n\nWhen the [symbol|footprint] library table contains a library folder at the\nlibrary path (env var) that doesn't exist, there is an error message dialog\nwhen opening libedit or eeschema. And there is a dialog for every single\nerror. The dialog allows me to not see an error again, but since libraries\nappear and disappear as I switch branches I never check that box. I always\nkeep my library tables in sync with the head rev of the library master and\nthen deal with error that come about. Seeing this dialog frequently is\nannoying because it's not something I will actually solve since it goes\naway once I merge the PR branch into master. Pcbnew and the footprint\neditor have a similar dialog, again once for each missing library folder,\nbut there is no checkbox.\n\nConversely, if there are libraries at the library path but not in the\nlibrary table there is no alert about that and libraries can be missed.\nThis could also apply to symbol or footprint libraries.\n\nI wonder if there is a way to improve the situation when the library table\nand library folders have a mismatch?\n1. If the library folder is missing. If I check the box in the error dialog\nI might miss something later on when I switch to the master branch. I guess\nthere is a way to disable to \"never show again\" checkbox but I don't find\nit user-accessible. Is it? If not, perhaps put this option in the tool UI\nsince someone could regret being able to turn on \"never do something\" and\nnot turn it off? It might also be nice to load all libraries and then show\na single dialog of all missing library folders instead of individual\ndialogs.\n2. If there are extra library folders. The potential solution here is more\nobvious and straightforward. A dialog could appear which offers to update\nthe lib table and add the new libraries. And again, a single dialog for all\nnew libraries would be nice. And a \"never show again\" checkbox on the\ndialog, again with a re-enable in the tool options, would work.\n\nI understand if this is too much of a niche situation to spend any time on.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2

They are also not good for laptops.\nfor example, the \"Zoom Fit\" is the Home button which is not that good to\napply it.\n\n\n2. All of the shortcuts on the \"Place\" menu have the \"Shift\" key on it, but\nthey do not use it. So they are not well indicated on the menus.\n\nI feel that the whole shortcut scheme should be improved. They are OS\ndependent.

hierarchical sheet to its parent simply\nby dragging floating symbol up to the top icon area to \"Leave sheet\" icon.\nClicking the icon we really left the hierarchical and got back to the\nparent, but instead of keep dragging the symbol, the whole hier.sheet\ndragged on (issue A).\n\nIn this state when I try to drop (the symbol or the hierarchical sheet,\nwhichever) down, nothing happens  clicking the left mouse button (issue B).\nFinally I push Esc to leave/move back hier.sheet to its original position.\n\nNow I double click on the hier.sheet again. Instead of moving into the\nsheet, we stay at the parent, but hier.sheet jumps back to its last\ntemporary position of when Esc has been pushed (Issue C).\n\nIf I drop the sheet to a new position, then try to Undo, it can't be un-\ndone. (Issue D)\n\nThese are not serious issues, as I tried to do \"something stupid\", and that\ncaused the weird behaviour, still...\n```\nOriginal tags:
