naming propblem (lp:#1824782)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1824782) created by **Anton (antonpupkov)**\n```\nI once got the name of a chain of the form Net-D?5BC1522A-Pad3, it was\npreceded by removing and adding the modified schematic element the same\nelement of eeschema schematic, which corresponds to footprint on video. The\nproject was created in kicad 4, on components under kicad 4, but the\ncomponent that is being worked on in the video is added from the latest git\nbuild for kicad 5. With other components not tested. The problem is that\nfor some reason you have to call \"Update from schematic\" twice.\n\nOne more moment. For some reason, the footprint is not always updated when\nit is edited and saved in the editor, when you click \"Update from\nschematic\". You have to remove is the footprint, the reassignment with new\nchanges footprint in schematic does not help. Remove footprint leads to\ndifficulties re-positioning after updating (applying changes from the\nschematic). For example, Housing DIP-40.\n\nI know that there is such a button \"update footprint on current PCB\". The\nmost interesting thing is that it becomes inactive when you open the\nfootprint from the printed circuit Board for editing and save it in another\n(your library). Perhaps there is no reference in the current assignment to\nthis footprint yet. Well, reassign the component changed footprint, but\nwhen you apply an update from the scheme footprint does not change, is not\nupdated to a new one. For example, some footprint are the wrong diameter\nplanting holes. Default is 0.8 the hole and in fact the electronic\ncomponent, the diameter of the pin is 0.5. The hole should be 0.6.\nTherefore, the footprints have to be corrected and, in order not to change\nthe default footprints, I save the changed ones in a separate place, which\nis available for both reading and editing.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0-247-g252934694), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.63.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1a zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2\n(+libidn2/2.0.4) libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Linux 4.19.8-arch1-1-ARCH x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.63.0\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.1 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-15T09:21:36.606Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:21:37.707Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T23:05:24.427Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085327,"iid":6,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.2/+download/kicad-5.1.2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.2/+download/kicad-5.1.2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:16:33.152Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:29:57.270Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/6"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":20,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/568","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/568","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/568/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/568/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#568","relative":"#568","full":"kicad/code/kicad#568"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27806879,"iid":85,"project_id":15502567,"title":"PCBNEW part pads loses schematic net definition, V5.1.1 (lp:#1824764)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1824764) created by **m (mwddust)**\n```\nHave just updated to V5.1.1 and now noticed that if added or edited symbol\nthe PCB part loses pad net definitions.

hierarchical sheet containing both a hierarchical label and a\nglobal label with the same name, the netlister and the ERC treat the\nconnectivity differently.  For example, in a schematic I'm working with\nnow, I have a hierarchical label and a global label both named \"0VDCA\".\n\n1. The netlister connects the two in the same net.\n2. The ERC warns that the global label is disconnected.\n\nI don't know if this is a regression or not because I believe I have\nseveral schematics which rely on behavior #1 and don't recall having gotten\nany ERC warnings before.

and actual printout has low resolution and\njagged edges. Some pads seem displaced and text is barely legible. If I\nplot a PDF with the integrated plot function the PDF is clean and I can\nprint it without major issues but there seems to be a scaling issue as the\nprintout is slightly smaller than 1:1.\n\nI noticed that KiCAD 5.1 uses the system PDF renderer for generating the\npreview and probably also for printing. In my case this was Xreader 1.6. I\nreplaced this in my Linux Mint system by Okular and now although the\nrenderer is the Okular one I get the same result as before. Again If I open\na PDF generated by the plot function in Okular I can print it correctly\nwith slight scaling errors.\n\nI have several printers installed in my system and they all show the same\nbehaviour.\n\nPrinting worked perfectly in KiCAD 4.0.2 which I was using before KiCAD5.1.\nSince I now have a broken output function I will be forced to go back to\nKiCAD4.x\n\nI will be happy to help and test any fixes.\n\nVersion Info\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.0-060a0da~80~ubuntu16.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.47.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2g zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.32 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.15.0-47-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.58.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.47.0\n    Compiler: GCC 5.4.0 with C++ ABI 1009\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: printing","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-11T20:14:41.995Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:21:53.164Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T23:05:04.825Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["printing","priority::undecided","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085327,"iid":6,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.2/+download/kicad-5.1.2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.2/+download/kicad-5.1.2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:16:33.152Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:29:57.270Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/6"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/566","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/566","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/566/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/566/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#566","relative":"#566","full":"kicad/code/kicad#566"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27928785,"iid":2704,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Partially broken undo in eeschema (lp:#1824403)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1824403) created by **Ron Burkey (rburkey)**\n```\nIf you perform an operation that (as a side effect) splits an existing wire\ninto two parts and adds a junction, undoing that operation does not restore\nthe wire properly.\n\nI've attached an image that's a composite of several screenshots that\nillustrates the issue.

It would be very good to have\nthe whole configuration of the branch in one place (single configuration\ndirectories for each milestone). For example, the 4 branch of eeschema\nrecognizes the file .eeschema at the root of the home folder when already\nthere .config/kicad in General turns out to be different. In addition, the\ntransition from branch to branch will be more independent, convenient and\nproductive. I mean from kicad4 to kicad5 and so on.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-08T06:49:33.495Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:09:57.273Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T15:09:57.033Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3354","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3354","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3354/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3354/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3354","relative":"#3354","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3354"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27802447,"iid":23,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Crash when invoking footprint wizard (lp:#1823608)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1823608) created by **Paul Kenyon (rixoff)**\n```\nIn KiCad, Footprint Editor (opened from main project view), when clicking\non the \"New footprint using footprint wizard\" button, all of KiCad crashes.\nA new window opens for about one second before this crash occurs.\n\nThis happens with Accelerated, Fallback, and Legacy Toolsets.\n\nI have barely worked with footprints at all.

The system immediately high\nlights the text which, based on what actually happens, obviously actions a\ncopy command which in turn supers imposes any previously issued copy\ncommand within the entire OS. May it be an ordinary ctrl+c/ctrl+v, or the\nunix/linux build in copy by high light functionality.\n\nEven within Eeschema itself there is no way to copy field texts between\nsymbols other than the automatically high lighted text in the target field\nitself.\n\nEven attempts to copy some text from outside an open symbol dialogue box\n(E, V, U) are futile since as soon as the focus returns to the dialogue box\nKiCad again will automatically high light the text (and commit its value to\nthe copy buffer) where ever the cursor left off. Definitely unwanted\nbehaviour.\n\nThis is rather disturbing and extremely annoying to put it mildly.\n\nI reverted back to 5.02 which does the auto high light as well though it is\npossible to copy and paste text (e.g. special symbols) into an open\ndialogue box from any system clip board source.\n\nThe unix/linux paste by middle mouse click does not work anymore in 5.1!\n\nReverting back and forth between 5.1 and 5.02 shows that his\n(mis)-behaviour is consistent.\n\n5.02 limpingly ‘works’ while 5.1 does not.\n\n\u003c----------------------\u003e\n\nA temporary ‘workaround’ as follows.\n\nDid some more testing and the only way to paste text into e.g. E,V,U of any\nsymbol within Eeschema is:\n\n    issue an E, V, U command over any symbol.\n    delete field contents\n    only THEN copy/paste from wherever\n    insert as per usual ctrl+c, or middle mouse button click\n\nKind of a pain, but will have to do short of down grading to 5.02\n\nThe same behaviour applies to the Edit Symbol Fields dialogue.\n\nGoing by the behaviour as such it suggests an issue in relation with GTK.\n\n\u003c-------------------\u003e\n\nFurther tests in 5.1 Pcbnewl reveals inconsistent behaviour.\n\nAn E over any text property like component value, reference still appears\nto have the same behaviour as version 5.02. Meaning here it is possible the\npaste as usual.\n\nHowever an E over any component itself does exhibit the same flaw as in\nEeschema, probably due to the same gtk dialogue used.\n\nApart from the above KiCad is a great tool. Beats eagle any time.\n\n\u003c--------------------\u003e\n\nTo drill down on the issue I did a git pull and re-compile on the 5.1\nbranch. Behaviour is till present.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nCheers\n\nJohannes\nJos\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema gtk pcbnew ui","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-07T03:31:34.172Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T16:08:20.437Z","closed_at":"2021-07-05T16:08:20.429Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["eeschema","gtk","pcbnew","priority::low","status::resolved","ui"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1888","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1888","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1888/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1888/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1888","relative":"#1888","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1888"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27929555,"iid":2775,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Schematic changes not fully transferred to pcbnew unless eeschema is closed (lp:#1823497)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1823497) created by **Oleg Endo (oleg.endo)**\n```\nI have noticed this started happening a few days ago.\n\nWhen using the \"Update PCB from schematic\" button in pcbnew some changes to\nthe schematic are not reflected until eeschema is closed.

it.\n\nPlease find attached an archive with my files and the backtrace I got. The\nfile which crash is board_defis_solaires_2.sch\n\nThe issue seems to have something to do with graphic stuff. Please mind\nthat I have an NVIDIA Video card.\n\nBest regard,\nJulien FAUCHER\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.0-unknown-428e7a9~94~ubuntu18.10.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n

(bisected) eeschema crashes while opening a \"more\ncomplex\" schematic.\nThe pic_programmer demo can be opened without any issues. But \"bigger\"\nprojects lead to an immediate crash. Reverting the commit resolves this\nissue.\n\nWith one project there is a \"kicad Error\" dialog with the message\n\"Unhandled exception class: St9bad_alloc  what: std::bad_alloc\"\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open demo project \"complex_hierarchy\" with kicad launcher.\n2.

error when courtyard is a circle between .04 and 0.07mm (lp:#1822641)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1822641) created by **Joel (jsantosrico)**\n```\nI get a \"Footprint has Incorrect courtyard (not a closed shape)\" DRC error\nwhen the courtyard is defined as a circle with a diameter between 0.04mm\nand 0.07mm. The error has started appearing when I updated to Kicad 5.1 (it\nwas not present in v4 or v5.0). I use Windows 10.\n\nI have some parts that are meant to be on top of others: PCB elements, like\npredesigned track patterns or PCB antennas, silkscreen elements, like text\nthat I want to keep as a “footprint”, or logos, etc… I don’t want to\ntrigger DRC errors with them, but if I define a courtyard, it will trigger\na courtyard collision, and if I don’t, it will trigger a lack of courtyard\nerror. I settled for a small circle in the courtyard area (because it’s\nonly two clicks, instead of 4 of a rectangle, and I like the circle\nbetter). I noticed that the error only triggered for a certain part and not\nfor others with the same circular courtyard. After some testing, I noticed\nthat the error would only trigger if the circle radius is between 0.037 and\n0.072mm. My circles' lines are 0.05mm wide. Forum user paulvdh made a test\nPCB that can be used to trigger the error. It's attached to this bug\nreport.

\"Net Class Memberships\" UI (lp:#1822493)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1822493) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nNet Class Memberships in the Board Setup-\u003eNet Classes is unnecessarily\ncomplex. It could be simplified if filtering was more consistent with some\nother filtering UIs inside KiCad (and also in many other programs). A\nmockup UI screenshot is attached. There are many possible varieties, for\nexample add checkboxes next to filter fields. Or the group box and its\nlabel could be replaced by a label \"Filters:\" next to the filter fields;\nthat would make the whole filter a one-liner. But this suggestion is almost\nthe simplest possible and I believe it's immediately intuitive.\n\nIt would work like many other filters: if there's filter text, the filter\nis active. If not, everything is shown. There's no need for two buttons for\napplying and unapplying the filters. Filtering would happen on-the-fly like\nwith component lists in component selectors.\n\nThe location above the filtered list is more natural and a new user can\nmake mental connection between the filter and the list immediately (unlike\nwith the current UI where you have to think for a while what is filtered\nand how).\n\nI would also move the filters/list to left hand (in LTR language UIs)\nbecause the flow would be more natural: filter and select first, then\nassign.\n\nFor reference, see https://forum.kicad.info/t/how-to-get-to-design-rules-\neditor-in-5-1-0/16049.\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0-49-gc1c4a0925), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: feature.request pcbnew ui","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-31T18:38:24.899Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T22:23:15.741Z","closed_at":"2021-09-24T22:23:15.732Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["feature-request","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed","ui"],"milestone":{"id":1387731,"iid":16,"project_id":15502567,"title":"7.0","description":"Planning milestone for 7.0 issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T16:23:39.606Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T23:37:00.768Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/16"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2374","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":14,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2374","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2374/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2374/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2374","relative":"#2374","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2374"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27815974,"iid":639,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Pcbnew: Scaling issue (lp:#1822492)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1822492) created by **Daniel Giesbrecht (giesbrecht)**\n```\nAttached is a PNG screen-shot of Pcbnew.\n\nSystem information:\n- OS:                  Ubuntu 18.10\n- Display resolution:  3840x2160, 200% scaling\n\nKiCad (5.1-stable) version information can be found at the bottom of this\nreport.\n\nThe working area of Pcbnew (containing white dotted grid) is scaled to the\nbottom-left 1/4 of the screen.

through-hole pads and\nremove everything else.\nThis way it is possible to have (or easily build) a footprint that will\nmatch a board.\n\nThis is for the principle, but it might be enhanced by, in example, letting\nthe user change the footprint of the connectors, or by handling a selection\nof board footprints to add to the new footprint.\n\nBest regards,\nJulien FAUCHER\n\nApplication:

place/width change shorcut experience (lp:#1822435)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1822435) created by **Hildo Guillardi Júnior (hildogjr)**\n```\nMay be my opinion, I think this will improve the UX.\n\nIn Pcbnew, nowdays, we have this behavior:\n\"x\" start trace place;\n\u003cShift\u003e+\u003cCtrl\u003e+\"v\" start the place via tool;\n\"w\" increase the trace width;\n\u003cCtrl\u003e+\"w\" decrease the trace width;\n\"'\" increase the via size;\n\"\\\" descrease the via size.\n\nThere are a lot of \"not grouped\" shortcut. It is difficult for user to\nremember. My propose is the width/size change shorcut just be accessibly in\nthe on tool and group the shortcut in group:\n\nTo trace tool\n\"w\" start the trace place tool, if other tool is actived;\n\"w\" if the trace place already activated, increase it width\n\u003cShift\u003e + \"w\" if the trace place already activated, decrease it width. If\nnot actived it does nothing.\n\nTo via tool\n\"x\" start the via place, if other tool is actived;\n\"x\" if the trace place already activated, increase it size\n\u003cShift\u003e + \"x\" if the trace place already activated, decrease it size. If\nnot actived it does nothing.\n\n\nAlso proposing not use \u003cShift\u003e+\u003cCtrl\u003e+v to place via. I could propose use\njust \"v\" to active this tool but, this shortcut is already used for change\nlayer view.\n\n\nThis way of group and access the characteristic/parameter change of each\ntool (the trace and via tool) could be expended to all tool that have this\nkind of behavior. Making me, user to easy remember the shortcuts.\n\n\nApplication: pcbnew\nVersion: 5.1.0-unknown-a7270f8~82~ubuntu16.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.47.0

In Symbol Properties window, click on \"Browse Library\" and in\n\"Choose symbol\" window, select a multi part symbol. Validate.\n\n(Unit dropdown list is greyed.)\n\nValidate.\n\nThe symbol now looks funky with all the parts rendered stacked.\nThe component reference has a \"@\" char at the end.\n\nEdit that symbol again.\n\nIn Symbol Properties window, \"Unit\" dropdown list is now enabled but no\nunit selected by default. Choose a unit.\n\nValidate.\n\nThings are back to normal. No more stacked parts.\n\n\nNow, two different behaviours:\n\n1) if you selected the first unit (A), no problem\n\n2) but if you selected any other part (B, C, etc...) and you go back to\nSymbol Properties and choose a single part unit, say a resistor, and\nvalidate:\n\nyour symbol has NO pin.\n\nYou need to edit the symbol again, choose any multi part, validate, edit\nagain, choose unit A, validate, edit again (!) and then choose your single\npart unit.\n\n\nTested both on Windows and Linux.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.0-060a0da~80~ubuntu16.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.47.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2g zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.32 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.4.0-143-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.58.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.47.0\n    Compiler: GCC 5.4.0 with C++ ABI 1009\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-29T12:47:11.511Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:22:43.617Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T17:52:35.749Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085254,"iid":2,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.1","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.1/+download/kicad-5.1.1.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.1/+download/kicad-5.1.1.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T14:05:30.747Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:29:34.439Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/2"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/164","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/164","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/164/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/164/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#164","relative":"#164","full":"kicad/code/kicad#164"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
