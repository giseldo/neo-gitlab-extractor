It's absolute value is\nsomewhat immaterial as most board houses will use the edge cuts to position\nthe footprints.  Essentially all it does is tell us where to draw the page\nboundaries and page frame.\n\nWe also have a drill origin, which is user settable.  I suspect this is\nmostly legacy, as most manufacturers are happy enough without one.  But\nconceptually one could make an argument that it should set the origin for\n/all/ file values, not just drill file values.  This is probably a low\nvalue change.\n\nWe also have a grid origin, which is user settable.  Conceptually we think\nof this as just a grid origin, but many of our users think of it as the\nediting/display origin (which, to be honest, makes more sense).\n\nWhen locations are edited through the UI, they are presented relative to\nfile origin.  There's no particular value in this, while there would be\n/considerable/ value in presenting them relative to the grid origin.\n\nOne bug report suggests adding textboxes for grid-relative positions to the\nexisting textboxes for file-relative positions.  I believe this would be a\nmistake as it just complicates the UI and the file-relative positions have\nlittle value to the user.\n\nFor 6.0, I would recommend we change the GUI positions to grid-origin-\nrelative.\n\nI can also see an argument for changing the file positions to drill-origin-\nrelative, but I'm ambivalent about that.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-05-27T10:11:10.393Z","updated_at":"2021-01-02T12:48:50.362Z","closed_at":"2020-08-28T10:15:23.731Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff

The problem is that there isn't a no-connection flag. Thus I\nsuggest this should read:\n\nErrType(2): Pin not connected (and a no-connection flag was not found on\nthis pin)\n    @ (4.000 in,3.500 in): Pin 57 (Bidirectional) of component U1 is\nunconnected.\n\n1) This avoids torturing English syntax (and those who struggle to read\nEnglish) by avoiding using a double \"no\", as in \"(and no no connect symbol\nfound on this pin)\".\n\n2) The documentation for Eeschema refers to this as a \"No connection flag\",\nrather than a symbol, as does the hover text for the tool bar icon which\nreads \"Place no connection flag\". Either the error should call it a \"flag\"\nor the hover text should say \"symbol\". I like \"flag\", as this doesn't\nappear in a symbol library and this is how it is referred to in the\ndocumentation.\n\n3) The error message and hover text would be clearer with a hyphen: \"Place\nno-connection flag\". This avoids suggesting that you are not placing a\nconnection flag. If we're feeling hyphen-averse, place quotes around \"no\nconnect\" as done in the documentation:\n\nErrType(2): Pin not connected (and a \"no connection\" flag was not found on\nthis pin)\n    @ (4.000 in,3.500 in): Pin 57 (Bidirectional) of component U1 is\nunconnected.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nBuilt from sources on a private branch derived from this Git commit:\n    8f6ae70

This is a problem when an inner layer contains a copper plane, as\nthe components on the bottom are not visible when working with another\ninner layer.\n\nFor example, create a 4-layer board with a plane on one of the inner\nlayers. Place components on both top and bottom, then flip the board in the\nView menu. Unless a bottom layer is selected the components on the bottom\nare invisible even though they are on the side being viewed, while\ncomponents on the top are still visible through the plane. Selecting the\nbottom copper layer causes the bottom component to be visible but\ndisappears again if another layer is selected, such as when a via to\nanother layer is placed.\n\nAnother example of this without requiring filled inner layers is that top\npads overlay bottom pads if a neutral layer like Edge.Cuts is selected.\n\nWhile this can be worked around by displaying planes in outline mode or\nmaking them somewhat transparent, it makes more sense for the layers to be\nstacked in reverse order when viewing a flipped board.\n\n\nBuilt from sources from a private branch derived from this

not set/available/settable when running eeschema stand alone (lp:#1769522)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1769522) created by **Piotr Esden-Tempski (esden)**\n```\nI am not 100% sure if it is a bug or intended behaviour. I assume it is\nintended that KIPRJMOD is not set when starting eeschema stand alone but\ndue to lack of relative path support in sym-lib-table uri this causes\nissues. More info follows...\n\nWhat I am trying to do:\nI have a project with local schematic libraries that are located relatively\nto the project. In sym-lib-table I am setting all the paths relative to\nKIPRJMOD variable. (Relative paths to the sym-lib-table file do not work\nwithout the use of ${KIPRJMOD} prefix but that is probably a separate bug)\n\nI am trying to open the schematic stand alone to be able to\ninsert/cut\u0026paste schematic blocks from other schematics.\n\nSymptoms:\n- When opening the schematic using eeschema the sym-lib-table is loaded but\nthe KIPRJMOD variable is not set.\n- Setting the KIPRJMOD environment variable on the command line before\nlaunching eeschema does not have any effect. (it does not even apper in the\nPreferences-\u003eConfigure Paths... dialogue.\n- Setting the KIPRJMOD in the Preferences-\u003eConfigure Paths... after\nlaunching eeschema does not have a desired effect of the libraries being\nfound.\n\nPossible solutions:\n- Allow the command line environment variables to override the eeschema\npath variables as well as add to the list of set path variables.\n- Invalidate and reload schematic libraries after setting a path variable.\n- Allow for relative uri in sym-lib-table without the use of KIPRJMOD\nprefix.\n\nNote:\nThis is all not a problem when running full KiCad and opening the schematic\nfrom the main window. The KIPRJMOD variable is being set then and\neverything works as intended.\n\nVersion of KiCad used:\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.0.0-rc2-dev-unknown-1f5b575~64~ubuntu16.04.1, release

the way wire to bus and bus to bus entry is placed in\nschematic. This is only regarding usability and user interface and nothing\nto do with functionality.\n\nHere is the way I think would be better:\n\n1) 1st click sets anchor position. Normally you click on end of wire for\nwhich you need wire to bus entry.\n2) Then bus entry is drawn on screen (in last used orientation). By\ndragging mouse around anchor position, bus entry would snap to one of four\npossible orientations.\n3) Second click confirms orientation and places bus entry in schematic.\nAlso saves last used orientation for future usage.\n\n\nCurrently some wire orientations require to click on offset position away\nfrom wire/bus, I often get that wrong if doing fast. Also changing\norientation requires few more clicks. And I never remember what was last\nused orientation.\n\nThe proposed way would only add second click. And If you use same\norientation as previously, it would be very fast.\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema

the tracks. I mean with a\nboard almost fully wired pcbnew crashes. Running again pcbnew I see only\nratsnetst opening the .kicad-pcb file.\n\nI can re-take my work with deleting .kicad_pcb and renaming .kicad_pcb-bak\nto .kicad_pcb.\nIt happens randomly approx. once in every couple days of heavy using kicad.\n\nLatest \"void\" .kicad_pcb file is much smaller than previous good (from\n-bak version). I attach both example files...maybe something turnes out.\n\nI guess it is not enough info to do anything with it, so the real question\nis:\nis there any way to investigate a case like this?  Some log or journal\nfile, or running in a debugger?\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-29T16:55:37.347Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T00:06:37.366Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T23:54:40.908Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::critical","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1087157,"iid":12,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.0.0-rc2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-03T06:48:31.614Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:32:07.740Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":2247153,"username":"orsonmmz","name":"Maciej Sumiński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2247153/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/orsonmmz"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":2247153,"username":"orsonmmz","name":"Maciej Sumiński","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2247153/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/orsonmmz"},"user_notes_count":51,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1671","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1671","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1671/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1671/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1671","relative":"#1671","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1671"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27912263,"iid":1653,"project_id":15502567,"title":"It is no longer possible to expand groups in the \"Edit Symbol Fields\" window (lp:#1767746)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1767746) created by **Ben Gamari (bgamari)**\n```\nIn my build of Kicad `master` from a few months ago (mid March 2018, I\nbelieve) it is possible to expand groups in eeschema's \"Edit Symbol Fields\"\nwindow.

When you highlight a footprint\nin PCBNew the cursor in EESchema should theoretically jump to the\ncorresponding symbol in the schematics.  However, quite often this doesn't\nhappen.  I use dual monitor setup, so I can have schematics and the board\nvisible at the same time.  If I'm working with the EESchema (EESchema\nwindow is active) and I move the cursor to the other monitor and click on a\nfootprint, the footprint become highlighted but the cursor in the EEschema\ndoesn't move to the corresponding symbol.  You need to click on the same\nfootprint again for the cursor in EESchema to move.\n\nAnother issue I see there is kind of intermittent.  Sometimes the cursor\nmoves not really on the center of the symbol.  If I click on some other\nfootprint and then on the same one, the second time around it will move to\nthe center.  However it is hard to reproduce consistently\n\nAnd last but not least, if you highlight a footprint and the corresponding\nsymbol is right at the edge of the EESchema window, the view is not going\nto pan and it is really hard to see when did the cursor actually jump.\nThere needs to be some kind of offset from the edge of the window, so when\nthe symbol falls in that offset then the screen gets re-centered on the\nsymbol.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-dev-414-gc1ae2fd0a), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n    libcurl/7.54.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2l zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.23.1\nlibrtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.3 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.60.0\n    Curl: 7.54.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.1.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-25T18:42:05.208Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T12:36:23.165Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T12:35:20.404Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::low","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2897","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":12,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2897","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2897/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2897/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2897","relative":"#2897","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2897"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27922703,"iid":2130,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Spice model parameters (lp:#1766931)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1766931) created by **JKB (joel-bertrand)**\n```\nI use sometimes model parameters.

(reece-pollack)**\n```\nWhen ripping up (deleting) a parts of routed track, sometimes the delete\ntool remains selected and sometimes it doesn't.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any pattern I can discern. Sometimes I have to\nclick on the trashcan icon to reselect the delete tool and sometimes it\nremains selected. No special setup is needed to observe this.\n\nAlso... when deleting a track by clicking very close to the pad of a\ndevice, every so often the device will get deleted too with the same click.\n\"Undelete\" will restore the device. At first I thought I might have\naccidentally double-clicked, but I no longer believe this is likely.\n\nWhile I'm complaining... why does KiCad use the same tool to rip up tracks\nas deleting components? This is dangerous and should be changed to provide\nseparate rip-up and delete tools.\n\nBuilt from source on a private branch descended from this commit:\n    07dc12f Fix incorrect UI management of Zoom to Selection, created by\nfix 2a419156\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-dev-440-gd458cd5-dirty), debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.47.0 GnuTLS/3.4.10 zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.32 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.13.0-38-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.58.0\n    Curl: 7.47.0\n    Compiler: GCC 5.4.0 with C++ ABI 1009\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=OFF\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-17T20:09:55.757Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T12:35:07.082Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T12:35:07.044Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::low","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2896","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2896","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2896/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2896/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2896","relative":"#2896","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2896"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27883904,"iid":1440,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Eeschema slow navigation (lp:#1764646)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1764646) created by **Fabián Inostroza (fabianinostroza)**\n```\nEeschema gets very slow when a schematic with large components or many\ncomponents is loaded and  almost all the page is shown.\n\nI've tried the project linked here\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1737363 by Chris Pavlina and with a\nmuch more simple project: just a Virtex 7 FPGA with no other components.\n\nWhen the zoom level is zoom to fit the crosshair lags considerably behind\nthe mouse cursor and the kicad process uses near 100% cpu.

package3d folders), no symbols rescued.\nWhen I load SCH file and schematic symbols are out of reach, I get no any\nmessage of creating rescue. Schematic drawing simply displayed with empty\nboxes instead of real components.\n\nThis happens with SCH files (ver 4, containing libname:symbolname) and\nnewest nightly 10035.\n\nIt is important for me because formerly I might send full project folder to\nco-workers --even when having newly created symbols. They could easily open\nthe schematic by creating a rescue lib: everything was \"self-contained\".\nNow it doesn't work:(\n```\nOriginal tags:

wishlist: highlight pin as well as net (lp:#1763873)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1763873) created by **Reece Pollack (reece-pollack)**\n```\nThe ability to highlight a net is a welcome addition to eeschema in V5.\nHowever, it would be even better if it highlighted connected pins as well\nas connected nets. This would make it much easier to see if a net actually\nconnects to device pins.\n\nYes, you can look for the tiny square boxes to see if the pin is connected\nto a net. That /should/ help, but it's easy to overlook. Currently the best\nway to check is to drag the component away from its intended position and\nsee whether the nets stay attached, but doing that with every device on a\ngiven net is more time consuming than highlighting the net and looking for\nhighlighted pins.\n\nThis suggestion originated in the discussion of the related Bug #594073.\nSeth Hillbrand (@sethh) suggested it be submitted as a separate bug for\ninclusion in the V6 wishlist.\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-14T01:53:44.283Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T22:03:48.856Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T13:37:16.276Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::wishlist","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3090","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":38,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3090","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3090/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3090/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3090","relative":"#3090","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3090"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27940190,"iid":3347,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Give eeschema the same trackpad center/zoom as pcbnew (lp:#1763862)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1763862) created by **Robert Poor (rdpoor)**\n```\nVersion: KiCad v 5.0.0-rc2-dev-310 with “modern toolset”\nEnvironment: macOS v10.13.3 on a MacBook Pro (with trackpad)\n\nSummary: Give eeschema the same trackpad GUI for center / zoom as pcbnew\nuses\n\nDetails:\n\nI discovered (more or less by accident) that in pcbnew, I could \"two finger\ntap\" the trackpad to center the drawing at the current cursor location\n(i.e. bring drawing and cursor to the center of the screen), and then use\ntwo fingers on the trackpad to zoom in and out around that point.\n\nI found that to be intuitive and -- crucially -- a VERY FAST way to\nnavigate.\n\nThe same is not true in eeschema.

Footprint searching and viewing (lp:#1763200)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1763200) created by **Evan Shultz (evan-shultz)**\n```\nAt https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-symbols/pull/445 a KiCad user wrote \"I\nthink a search function for searching footprints would be really nice\".\n\nIn response to the user's question, I posted\nhttps://github.com/KiCad/kicad-symbols/pull/445#issuecomment-380595014.\nThis shows the Footprints window where text strings can be typed in and the\nlist of footprints filtered. Using this feature a user can find footprints\nmatching a query, but there isn't a preview of the footprint.\n\nThen at https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-\nsymbols/pull/445#issuecomment-380607963 the user responded with the Library\nBrowser window and said \"No I was looking for a possibility to search for\nan footprint when I'm defining an footprint of an symbol in the schematic\neditor\". That window does provide a preview of the footprint, but no\nsearching is possible.\n\nIt appears that there are 2 ways to search for footprints in Pcbnew or the\nfootprint editor, either by the footprint name or clicking on an individual\nfootprint and getting a preview, but neither method combines searching by\nfootprint name along with viewing the footprints. (Or I just don't know how\nto do it.) I also think it would be nice to combine searching by footprint\nname while also getting a footprint preview.\n\nI see that bugs 593660 and 593661 have a similar title, but they\nspecifically mention this in CvPcb so they're not quite what I've suggested\nabove.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-dev-114-g8fcbb64a4), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n    libcurl/7.54.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2l zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.23.1\nlibrtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.3 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.60.0\n    Curl: 7.54.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.1.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-11T22:58:19.195Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:19:37.982Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T15:06:58.975Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3333","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":14,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3333","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3333/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3333/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3333","relative":"#3333","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3333"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27912833,"iid":1736,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Keyboard shortcut \"/\" brings up shortcut list instead of changing track posture (lp:#1763105)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1763105) created by **Art (diametrix)**\n```\nIronically, when the shortcut list comes up after pressing \"/\", right there\nin the list is says \"Switch track posture -
