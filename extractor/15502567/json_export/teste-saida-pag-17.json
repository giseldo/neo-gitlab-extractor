However, when kicad creates\nboards with 32 copper layers, the additional graphical layers can not be\ndisplayed. This makes reviewing gerber files very challenging, as it\nrequires you to do the review in stages of 32 layers, as you aren't able to\nconcurrently view all the copper layers alongside mechanical or graphical.\n\nTo ensure Gerbview can support the output of a high layer count kicad\nboard, I think the layer limit should be increased to either 48 or 64. This\nallows users to see all layers (including mechanical and graphical) at\nonce, without having to break down the review process in stages.\n\nGiven the number of graphical or non-copper layers, this means that, when\ntrying to view a board with more than 18 copper layers, you encounter\nerrors because gerbview cannot properly display all the layers at once.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-18T18:01:24.833Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T19:42:53.167Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T11:27:17.067Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2762","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2762","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2762/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2762/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2762","relative":"#2762","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2762"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27933127,"iid":2917,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Aperture pad should not have a number (lp:#1809010)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1809010) created by **John Beard (john-j-beard)**\n```\nPaste-layer aperture-only pads do not have the name/number field disabled\nin the pad editor dialog, like NPTHs do.

feature IMO:\n\nFor fine-pitched QFN components, the pad shape for the paste layer should\nbe changeable to alternating wedges, which will allow for both wider\nopenings (more consistent paste application) and wider bounds between\nopenings (fewer solder bridges).\n\nThis can be done with some effort in the library, by stacking a triangular\nshape on the paste layer with a rectangular pad with the paste layer\nexcluded, but it would be nice if there was a way to do this without\njumping through hoops.\n\nSo, feature request: a checkbox that turns the paste layer for a\nrectangular pad into a triangle, with the pointy end towards one of the\nshorter sides of the rectangle, alternating by even/odd pad numbers.\n\n[1]

custom pads editable without exploding and recombining (lp:#1808314)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1808314) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nIn the report https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1775545 I wished for\nWYSIWYG editing for rectangular (and round) pads. Together with that it\nwould also be nice to be able to edit custom shaped pads without first\nexploding them and especially recombining them afterwards. It's quite\ntedious to first explode, then edit, then select the shape and the pad and\nthen combine. This was especially difficult when I edited pads on different\nlayers: copper, mask and paste, each of them shaped a bit differently, on\ntop of each other. In that case I can't even select pads to be combined\nwith selection box; every time I have to use the clarification menu (and\nunfortunately the great \"highlight the hovered item\" feature doesn't work\nin Windows).\n\nThis could behave so that the pad would be kind of exploded automatically.\nThe anchor pad would stay where it is. It could prevent moving the zone\noutlines outside the the anchor point. Or it would do the combining phase\nautomatically when the editing is over (the polygon is unselected) and give\nthe normal error message if the anchor point is outside the changed\npolygon.\n\nThere are two alternative behaviors: 1. In implementation level the pad is\nnot actually exploded, the edges are just moved. 2. In implementation level\n(and in visible level) the pad is actually exploded, but the connection\nbetween the anchor pad and the graphic polygon is kept and they are\ncombined back together automatically when the polygon is deselected.\n\nCustom pads in the copper layers can now be selected and moved like basic\npads. To keep it that way there could be a context menu action, like in the\nbug #1775545. \"Resize\" or maybe \"Edit in place\". It would still lessen the\nsteps by removing the need to re-select and combine the items again and\nagain.\n\nMaybe it could be possible to simply add automatic re-combining to the\ncurrent behavior. Even that would make the whole process of editing custom\npads easier.\n```\nOriginal tags:

For example, if there's a symmetric footprint around 2\naxis and each corner has a similar asymmetric pad (see\nhttp://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lp5907.pdf, x2son footprint as an\nexample). It's impossible to see by eye where the pad should go relative to\nanother pad.\n\nGraphic polygons are easy to align because each corner and the middle of\nthe edge has a point where the cursor can grab. Therefore I suggest that\npads could be grabbed at the same points, as if they where graphic\npolygons. This could work for all kinds of pads, I think. In this way\nedges/corners of a pad could easily be aligned with edges/corners of other\npads, even with pads of different size/shape. (This may require using full\nwindow crosshair cursor.)\n\nAnother, maybe simpler, option would be to bypass the cursor warping with\nsome special hotkey. I could find the point where I want to grab the pad\nbefore I press M and the cursor would stay in that relative place in the\npad.\n\n(Just grabbing automatically at anywhere isn't a good option, see\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1430881.)\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-12T11:47:19.332Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T15:23:37.903Z","closed_at":"2020-07-06T23:36:40.234Z","closed_by":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2304","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2304","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2304/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2304/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2304","relative":"#2304","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2304"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27878210,"iid":1093,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Graphic polygons are selected by clicking outside the polygon (lp:#1808141)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1808141) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nGraphic polygons are now selected when I click outside the polygon (in the\nfootprint editor).

Right now,\nI can draw zones only using legacy toolkit and then switching back to\nOpenGL.\n\nExample of working project:\nhttps://github.com/MR-DOS/gener5351\nExample of buggy project:\nhttps://github.com/MR-DOS/TDR_splitter\n\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 6.0.0-rc1-unknown-f6aed7c~66~ubuntu18.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2\n(+libidn2/2.0.4) nghttp2/1.32.1 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.18.0-12-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.65.1\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.58.0\n    Compiler: GCC 7.3.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: cairo cutout fill opengl pcbnew zone","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-09T14:38:53.129Z","updated_at":"2021-06-06T14:44:11.313Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T06:45:22.951Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::high","rendering","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/834","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/834","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/834/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/834/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#834","relative":"#834","full":"kicad/code/kicad#834"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27881224,"iid":1419,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Grid ID not in grid list (lp:#1807541)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1807541) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nI deleted the config directory and restarted KiCad from scratch.

something like:\n\n---\nSetting this option will mean that the symbol in question will appear in\nthe \"add power port\" dialog. Additionally it will lock the value text to\nprotect it from editing in eeschema.\n---\n\n(English is not my first language so i guess the wording can be improved\ngreatly.

Opening the preferences menu however enters\nsome value to it. Might it be a good idea to have the icon scale set to\nautomatic on first setup? (Or keep the missing value if the slider has not\nmoved)\n\n\nTested in both windows and fedora.\n\nFedora version info (Under windows i used one from end of October):\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 6.0.0-rc1-unknown-r14484-ed6c68a1, debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.59.0 OpenSSL/1.1.0i zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2\n(+libidn2/2.0.4) libssh/0.8.5/openssl/zlib nghttp2/1.32.1\nPlatform: Linux 4.18.18-200.fc28.x86_64 x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.66.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.59.0\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.1 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=OFF\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-11-24T09:34:11.166Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:31:08.043Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T09:24:16.572Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1400","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1400","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1400/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1400/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1400","relative":"#1400","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1400"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null}]
