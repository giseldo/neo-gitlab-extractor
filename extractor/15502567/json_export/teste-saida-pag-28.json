Pcbnew, and GerbView all have the option for disabling \"Center\nand warp cursor on zoom.\"  However, the \"Page Layout Editor\" has no such\noption.  Was this missed, because I would assume that this option would be\ncoheasive across all tools?\n\nAssociated to this - at some point in the future will there be 'Global'\nsettings that apply across all tools? (the above being a prime example)\nCurrently, not even the wording or usage of this feature is the same\nbetween the tools.  I.e. Eeschema calls it \"Center and warp cursor on zoom\"\nand GerbView calls it \"Do not center and warp cursor on zoom\" (the\ninversion).\n\nAs I come from using AutoCAD, having \"Center and warp cursor on zoom\" is a\nbit confusing and frustrating.  Actually, KiCAD is the only program\n(collective) that I've used that has this zoom method - so I assume it is\nnot very common.  It may be wise to have this option disabled by default\nespecially for newcomers (first impressions - less frustration).

That's good but the list of symbols for this lib contains many\nentries that do not belong to it. It also seems to take a lot of time to\ncreate this list.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n0. Start Kicad, open Eeschema and load a schematic.\n1. Move cursor above a symbol with an assigned FP, press 'F' and press\n\"Select\".\n2. In the lib browser, select a small lib (Battery) and cancel/close both\ndialogs.\n3. Add a resistor to the schematic, press 'F' and press \"Select\"\n  -\u003e lib browser opens with \"Battery\" selected. There are many more symbols\nlisted than before.\n\ngit bisect found commit f4ce8766e38 for this issue BUT only if Eeschema is\nopened from the Kicad control app. If Eeschema is run standalone it crashes\nat step 3.

see if my routing caused problems with the filled polygon I always\nhave to switch modes by clicking and then switch back.\n\nI am aware of the hotkeys \"Ctrl+B\" and \"B\" but \"Ctrl+B\" does not just\nremove the filling but also causes airwires between all the pins connected\nto the polygon, which is quite confusing and disturbing.\n\nMy suggestion would be:\n- Introduce a new hotkey (maybe Alt+B) to switch to \"Do not show filled\nareas in zones\"\n- Make the \"B\" hotkey not only (re)fill areas but switch to \"Show filled\nareas in zones\"-view, too.\n```\nOriginal tags:

issue, I encountered a segfault when moving a\npolygon point to overlap an existing point.  It does not happen frequently.\nMaybe about 1:100 when selecting points and moving them to overlap and then\nre-moving them so that they no longer overlap.\n\nIf I click on the two overlapping points without dragging, it appears that\nthey are merged.  But just clicking and dragging the points over each other\ndoes not merge them, so I can move them independently.\n\nTo reproduce, create a 5-segment copper zone and move the 5th point over\nthe 4th, fill, unfill, move the point again, wash, rinse, repeat.

This would save quite a\nbit of searching around, as the number of symbols and footprints grows.\nSomething very similar to this is already done in the Footprint Editor,\nwhere you can click to view the 3D rendering.

The header file is only taking care for i386, amd64 and arm\n(without dedicated further specialisation).\n\n 25 #if defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__APPLE__) || defined(__FreeBSD__)\n 26\n 27     #define LIBCONTEXT_COMPILER_gcc\n 28\n 29     #if defined(__linux__) || defined(__FreeBSD__)\n 30     #if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(__amd64__)\n 31         #define LIBCONTEXT_PLATFORM_linux_x86_64\n 32         #define LIBCONTEXT_CALL_CONVENTION\n 33     #elif __i386__\n 34         #define LIBCONTEXT_PLATFORM_linux_i386\n 35         #define LIBCONTEXT_CALL_CONVENTION\n 36     #elif __arm__\n 37         #define LIBCONTEXT_PLATFORM_linux_arm32\n 38         #define LIBCONTEXT_CALL_CONVENTION\n 39     #elif __aarch64__\n 40         #define LIBCONTEXT_PLATFORM_linux_arm64\n 41         #define LIBCONTEXT_CALL_CONVENTION\n 42     #endif\n\nThus is resulting that the initializer LIBCONTEXT_CALL_CONVENTION is only\ndefined for the platforms given in the header file.

You\nshould start with my first post there on 2018-03-08.\n\nI will repeat the same steps here, capturing screenshots and uploading the\narchives for verification.\n\nFor all test cases, I started out using the Modern Accelerated graphics.\n\nOpening the Gerbers from MAXIM, DS3170DK01A0 at\nhttps://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/tools/cad-\nlayout/gerber/DS3170DK01A0.ZIP, renamed with GBR extension: After getting a\ndialog mentioning a lot of unknown symbols, and then a long delay where the\nPC freezes, I get an unhandled exception class error. Then GerbView crashes\nand the window disappears. I'll post a screenshot.\n\nImporting the same Gerber files at once, not inside a ZIP archive, takes an\ninordinate amount of time loading before I gave up (more than 5 minutes).\n\nOpening them each individually, I see issues with the following:\nDRILL crashes\nSDRMB reports unexpected symbols\nSDRMT crashes with an unhandled exception I will post in the next comment\n\nUsing the Modern Fallback graphics still crashes when opening the ZIP\narchive. As does the Legacy graphics.\n\nI then tried the 672 pin layout from\nhttps://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/download/board-layout-\ntest/gerber.html. This imports but with a whole bunch of errors. Instead of\ncopying everything there you can import for yourself and see.\n\nHere is my KiCad info:\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-dev-114-g8fcbb64a4), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n    libcurl/7.54.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2l zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.23.1\nlibrtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.3 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.60.0\n    Curl: 7.54.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.1.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-13T23:29:57.099Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T00:39:07.168Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T00:14:30.357Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::critical","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1087157,"iid":12,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.0.0-rc2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-03T06:48:31.614Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:32:07.740Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":5016159,"username":"charrasjp","name":"jean-pierre charras","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e6ffad480164fc81191f281efe56b02?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/charrasjp"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016159,"username":"charrasjp","name":"jean-pierre charras","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e6ffad480164fc81191f281efe56b02?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/charrasjp"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1701","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1701","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1701/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1701/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1701","relative":"#1701","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1701"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27882208,"iid":1439,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Graphics acceleration in PcbNew causes segfault on Wayland (lp:#1755360)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1755360) created by **Dylan Mackenzie (ecstaticmorse)**\n```\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc1), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n    libcurl/7.55.1 OpenSSL/1.1.0g zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libpsl/0.18.0\n(+libidn2/2.0.3) libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.25.0\nPlatform: Linux 4.15.6-300.fc27.x86_64 x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.3 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 3.22\n    Boost: 1.64.0\n    Curl: 7.55.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.3.1 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=ON\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=OFF\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n\nWhen attempting to enable graphics acceleration mode while on Wayland,\nPcbNew segfaults with the attached coredump.\n\nThe segfault is triggered when `XQueryExtension` invokes the `LockDisplay`\nmacro, which attempts to dereference `Display-\u003elock_fns`.

Selection of layer in dropdown list does not actually select the layer (lp:#1754135)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1754135) created by **Aimylios (aimylios)**\n```\nAfter opening a couple of GERBER files in GerbView the active layer can be\nselected by clicking on a layer name in the \"Visibles\" list (a small\ntriangle appears left to the entry). This will bring the layer in the\nforeground, update the format info box and also select it in the dropdown\nlist in the upper toolbar.\n\nIt is also possible to just select a layer in the dropdown list. This will\nalso bring it in the foreground, but the format info box is not updated and\nthere is no triangle marking the entry in the \"Visibles\" list.\n\nThis is very confusing. In my opinion, selecting a layer in the dropdown\nlist should have the same effect as clicking on its name in the \"Visibles\"\nlist. At least the format info box at the right side of the dropdown list\nshould be updated (this is how I discovered this in the first place).\n\nI observe the same behaviour with recent builds of KiCad on both Linux and\nWindows. It is GAL-only, as the layer selection logic in the Legacy Toolset\nseems to be completely different.\n\n\n--------------------\nVersion information:\n\nApplication: gerbview\nVersion: 5.0.0-rc1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.55.1 OpenSSL/1.1.0g zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libpsl/0.18.0\n(+libidn2/2.0.3) libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.25.0\nPlatform: Linux 4.15.6-300.fc27.x86_64 x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.64.0\n    Curl: 7.55.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.3.1 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=OFF\n```\nOriginal tags: gal gerbview","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-07T19:02:51.505Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T22:57:13.871Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T22:57:13.831Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["gerbview","priority::low","rendering","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1087157,"iid":12,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.0.0-rc2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-03T06:48:31.614Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:32:07.740Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1550","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1550","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1550/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1550/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1550","relative":"#1550","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1550"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27918305,"iid":1774,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Eagle import ignores net class and net class settings (lp:#1754130)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1754130) created by **Jakub Kozdon (fldrivers)**\n```\nFile \u003e Import Project \u003e EAGLE CAD.

I can reproduce\nit with recent builds of KiCad on both Windows and Linux.\n\nI do have an EXCELLON drill file that was generated with Altium Designer\nand has the following file header:\nM48\n;Layer_Color=9474304\n;FILE_FORMAT=2:5\nINCH,LZ\n;TYPE=PLATED\n\nI can open this file in GerbView, but the scaling is not correct. The size\nof the individual drills is OK, but the x and y positions are scaled by a\nfactor of 10, i.e. if the correct position of a drill is x=0.1in y=0.1in\nGerbView shows it at x=1.0in y=1.0in. The corresponding GERBER files do not\nhave this issue.\n\nInterestingly, the format information in the upper toolbar says \"fmt: in\nX2.4 Y2.4 no TZ\" (see attached screenshot), but it should be X2.5 Y2.5\naccording to the file header. The GERBER files are correctly identified as\n\"fmt: in X2.5 Y2.5 no LZ\".\n\nUnfortunately I can not share the whole file, but I have extracted a small\npart of it that should be sufficient to demonstrate the problem.\n\n\n--------------------\nVersion information:\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-dev-70-g2da7199a3), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n

(lp:#1753362)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1753362) created by **Kevin Cozens (qq3dh7wn6set-fehmn-mm0v6n6x10rb)**\n```\nWhile working on a PCB I noticed that about half of the value and reference\ntext on the board is upside down. When I went to rotate the text I found\nthe rotation angles were limited to 0 or 90 degrees once again. I was told\nthat rotation angles greater than 90 are still possible if I change a\nsetting. However that setting is on a per footprint basis and requires\nseveral steps to make each change. It will be a lot of work to make all the\nchanges needed on my board with 25 ICs plus all the additional components.\nI have some observations and suggestions about this recent change to\npcbnew.\n\n1. File format change\n   The addition of a setting to limit rotations means there has been a file\nformat change which needs to be documented.\n\n2. Change the label in the dialog box for the setting\n   In the Footprint Text Properties dialog box the current text reads\n\"Unlock text orientation\". This is misleading. If the text is locked I\nshould not be able to change its rotation with the R key. A better label\nfor the setting is \"No text rotation limit\". I was originally going to\nsuggest \"Limit text rotation\" but that would be the opposite value for the\nsetting.\n\n3. Disable rotation angle choices when text rotation is limited\n   In the Footprint Text Properties dialog box the selections for angles \u003e\n90 should be disabled when the text rotation limit is in effect.\n\n4. Make the rotation limit setting global rather than per footprint\n   I would prefer setting the rotation limit at the project level or as a\nKicad setting (for all current projects and for future ones).\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-05T04:05:47.617Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T08:17:08.364Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T08:17:08.333Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1138","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1138","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1138/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1138/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1138","relative":"#1138","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1138"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27912170,"iid":1634,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Add Zoom to Selection in View menu bar  throughout various apps (lp:#1753339)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1753339) created by **Andrey Kuznetsov (kandrey89)**\n```\nPLEditor has Zoom to Selection in the menu bar and toolbar icon.\n\nAll the other apps:\npcbnew\neeschema\ngerbview (due to lack of View menu bar -\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1753337)\n\nPlease add Zoom to Selection to the View menu bar with the standard\nshortcut.
