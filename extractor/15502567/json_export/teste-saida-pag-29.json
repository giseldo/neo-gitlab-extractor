simulation with your faulty design and look at the error.\n\nNow quit KiCAD (completely)\n\nLaunch KiCAD, open a design which got a working simulation, simulate, close\nthe simulator and the design (eeschema).\nOpen another project through \"open recent\" which don't work under\nsimulation.\nSimulate in the same condition as the previous one (in example, both\ntransient simulations).\nYou'll see that the simulation seems to work fine... but you won't be able\nto select any signal.\n\nIn example, I link my working directory.\nLaunch the slowactivator project to check if it (don't) work.\n\nThen launch the \"phase\" project (you may need to adapt the path to the\n\"spice\" directory but even with the right path, you'll get some \".lib not\nfound\" errors ( cf #1753094 ) but it will simulate anyway...\n\nThen open the \"slowactivator\" project and simulate.\n\n Application: kicad\nVersion: 5.0.0-rc2-dev-unknown-d5ac7c0~62~ubuntu17.10.1, release build\nLibraries:\n

Symbol Name to be different from Symbol Value (lp:#1752485)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1752485) created by **Silviu Laurentiu (silviulaurentiu)**\n```\n     Regarding he structure of the symbols in the library file.\n     Let's have the look on the symbol structure at this moment:\n#\n# CMP_NAME\n#\nDEF CMP_NAME C 0 40 Y Y 1 F N\nF0 \"C\" 0 140 45 H V C CNN\nF1 \"CMP_NAME\" 0 200 40 H I C CNN\nF2 \"C_0805\" 0 -80 30 H V C CNN\nF3 \"\" 0 -90 10 H V C CNN\nF4 \"1.8pF\" 0 85 40 H V C CNN \"Value2\"\nF5 \"50V\" 0 -125 30 H V C CNN \"Voltage\"\nF6 \"10%\" 0 -170 30 H V C CNN \"Tolerance\"\nDRAW\nS -40 -50 -20 50 0 1 0 f\nS 20 -50 40 50 0 1 0 f\nX 1 1 -150 0 110 R 25 0 1 1 P\nX 2 2 150 0 110 L 25 0 1 1 P\nENDDRAW\nENDDEF\n\n     The same information is in three different places:\nhere:\n # **CMP_NAME**\n\nand here:\nDEF **CMP_NAME** C 0 40 Y Y 1 F N\n\nand here:\nF1 \"**CMP_NAME**\" 0 200 40 H I C CNN\n\n     Why is this needed? I don't know what to say.\n     But, in the symbol editor, I don't understand why Kicad, when I create\na symbol, don't allow me to have different names for symbol Name (DEF\nfield) and for Value (F1 field)?\n     However, after I placed the symbol in the schematic, the Eeschema\nallows me to change the Value.\n\n     In this moment, this situation involve for me a double work to change\nthe symbol Value, every time when a symbol is placed into a schematic. Do\nit one time in my life, it is not a problem, but when I have to do it 1000\ntimes in my life, it could be a problem.\n\n     In my opinion it will be a big advantage if symbol editor will allow\nme to have different names for Name and Value of the symbol.\n     For example, let's have a scenario:\n     Create a new symbol with below Value:\nC_SMD_0805_1.8pF_50V_10%_Ceramic_C0G_ID1802270001H. The symbol Name will be\nautomatically chosen the same by the symbol editor:\nC_SMD_0805_1.8pF_50V_10%_Ceramic_C0G_ID1802270001H. And after the symbol\nwill be placed in the schematic, I have to manually change above long Value\nwith 1.8pF.\n      If the symbol editor will allow me to set the symbol Value and then,\nwhen the symbol is saved, it will ask be for symbol Name (as Footprint\nEditor does it), a lot of time will be saved when the component will be\nused in the schematic design.\n\n     This is a solution for the problem in below discussion:\nhttps://forum.kicad.info/t/symbol-lib-same-value-but-different-name-\nhow/1837\n\n     Many thanks!\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema feature.request","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-03-01T03:52:09.263Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T23:06:29.962Z","closed_at":"2021-06-11T23:06:29.952Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["eeschema","feature-request","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2111","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2111","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2111/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2111/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2111","relative":"#2111","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2111"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27918887,"iid":1847,"project_id":15502567,"title":"PcbNew, FootPrint neditor - Mousewheel active outside canvas (lp:#1752424)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1752424) created by **Jan Smrz (jansmrz)**\n```\nUsually the mousewheel events are active only when the mouse cursor is\nabove the canvas (active drawing area).

Since there is no “group all of\nthis stuff into one thing” feature (which I admittedly hadn’t thought about\nuntil just now), my imported thing is a bunch of lines and arcs.\n\nTo move it, I turned off all of the layers except Cmts.User and used the\nmouse to draw a selection box around the imported lines. But! The selection\nincludes all sorts of other stuff which was invisible. Checking the “Items”\nvisibility I see that most things are selected — Footprints, References,\nPads, Tracks, Vias, Holes. But since their layers are turned off, they’re\nnot visible. (which is the expected result.)\n\nShouldn’t the block-select logic select only stuff which is actually\nvisible? That is, if the layer is not visible and I don’t see a thing, I\nshould not be able to select that thing, period.\n\n(Aside: is there any way to combine things like a mechanical outline DXF\nimported into an auxiliary layer? I designed a small board that goes behind\na front panel and I went to check whether it would actually fit, and\nrealized that while I can import the panel outline, moving it as one unit,\nwith an anchor point like any regular footprint, doesn’t work.)\n\nThanks, and I have to say that Kicad is really working out here. The two\nboards I want to fab this week are my 9th and 10th Kicad designs.\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-dev-16-g319b7cf), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.0.20 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.0\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 17.4.0 x86_64), 64 bit, Little endian, wxMac\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (UTF-8,STL containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.61.0\n    Curl: 7.43.0\n    Compiler: Clang 7.3.0 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=ON\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-27T01:39:04.310Z","updated_at":"2020-12-29T02:55:15.566Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T00:07:23.986Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::high","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1087157,"iid":12,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.0.0-rc2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-03T06:48:31.614Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:32:07.740Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1674","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":16,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1674","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1674/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1674/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1674","relative":"#1674","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1674"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27912318,"iid":1668,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Crash on break track operation (lp:#1751945)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1751945) created by **Andrzej Wolski (awolski)**\n```\n1.

Figured I would share my unbiased\nobservation.\n\nOk the problems:\n\n1. Clicking on a cell highlights the whole row.  Ok, not sure what is the\npoint of it, but I guess somebody thought it might be useful.  Double click\nthe cell I want to edit - nothing happens.  Weird.  After literally a\nminute of clicking on cells, I finally figured out that you need to click\nones to highlight a row, and then click ones again on a cell in the raw to\nenable editing.  0_0 There is The International Obfuscated C Code Contest,\nthere should be a category there for a GUI design, this interface would\ndefinitely score there!\n\n2. Now that I enabled editing of the cell, enter data and click on the row\nbelow to enter the data.  The data is entered in the cell below the cell I\nwas editing. O_O\n\n3 There are two description columns in my table.  I had to add a custom\nDescription field, because I needed to have part description accessible\nwhen I edit symbol in the schematic.  So one of those description fields\ncan't be edited at all (which partially contributed to the extended time of\ntrying to figure out how to edit cells in the problem  #1)\n\n4. It takes a while to arrange all the columns for more or less civilized\nediting (adjusting width of columns, disabling the one's that don't need to\nbe showing etc.)  Then if you exit the table and then enter again, all that\nediting is lost and you have to start from scratch.\n\nI personally would expect for the table to mimic Excel behavior for editing\nand saving data.  But maybe it is just me?\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-13T20:28:48.224Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T00:37:47.365Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T00:20:14.886Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1089112,"iid":1,"group_id":6593436,"title":"5.1.6","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-04T21:52:01.161Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T20:53:48.818Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2019-11-27","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/kicad/code/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1714","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":32,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1714","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1714/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1714/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1714","relative":"#1714","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1714"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27878457,"iid":1136,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema: editing fields inline in symbol properties window (lp:#1749220)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1749220) created by **simski (simski)**\n```\nversion in use:\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: no-vcs-found-3ad3869~61~ubuntu16.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.47.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2g zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.32 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.4.0-112-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.58.0\n    Curl: 7.47.0\n    Compiler: GCC 5.4.0 with C++ ABI 1009\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n\n\nwhen entering information for your bom, it would be very handy if you could\njust click a field and start typing, and use navigation like libreoffice\ncalc for the different fields. of course the mandatory field names should\nbe protected.

A few bugs have come up and have been fixed. It is\nvery fast and flexible, works with nested sheets, and so on. You can select\nvarious numbering schemes, different top and bottom ref designations, and\nso on.\n\nThe source can be downloaded at www.documenteddesigns.com. I wrote it as a\nsingle module to simplify the same code base for Windows/Linux/IOS.\n\nThe only issue is that it uses a command line/text menu rather than a GUI.\nI do not know how to write GUI code or c++ so the whole thing is written in\nwell-documented c.\n\nLack of back annotation and renumbering is a chronic problem with KiCad (I\nlove the software by the way).\n\nI believe my code could be ported to Kicad with minor effort by somebody\nwho is familiar with the GUI. At a minimum, a simple GUI menu with file\npick that calls RenumKicadPCB with the parameters filled would be all that\nis needed.\n\nThe way the code is written, it makes a copy of the schematic and PCB files\nso ideally it would be invoked with PCBNew and eeSchema closed from the\nmain Kicad menu.\n\nI would be delighted if we could work on this. As I said, the code is\nwritten, works, appears solid, it just needs a GUI and, possibly\nintegration with the Kicad menu.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me to discuss. The code is in us \"in the wild\"\nand people seem to like it.\n\nregards\n\nBrian Piccioni\nbrian@documenteddesigns.com\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema feature.request

Blair (nf6x)**\n```\nI recently had to design a product in which the industrial design dictated\nthat a lot of the components and routing had to be rotated 30 degrees.\nPlacement and routing would have been much easier if pcbnew supported\nrotating the grid around the grid origin. Any-angle routing came in handy\nfor making minor edits, but produced messy results when trying to route\nmultiple nets in parallel.\n\nMy workaround was to perform placement and routing of blocks of circuitry\nat normal orientation outside of the board outline. Then I'd pick up the\nentire block, rotate it 30 degrees, and try fitting it in place on the\nboard. I had to repeat this over and over until everything fit well. Making\nthe transition from the 30-degree section to 45/90 degree routing on the\nrest of the board was also difficult. And then I had to tear it all up and\ndo it all over again a few times through revisions of the design.\n\nThis all would have been so much easier if I could have rotated the\nplacement and routing grid by an arbitrary angle around the grid origin. I\nwould very much like to see better support for placement and routing off of\na 45/90 degree grid in a future release.\n\nI can imagine that a polar grid would also be very desirable for some\nproducts.\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-08T03:39:20.807Z","updated_at":"2020-03-28T14:17:13.867Z","closed_at":"2020-03-28T14:17:13.659Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2102","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":14,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2102","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2102/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2102/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2483"},"references":{"short":"#2102","relative":"#2102","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2102"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27912288,"iid":1659,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Eagle Import -

At this point\ntrying to load any other hole layer doesn't change the hole layer being\ndisplayed.\n\nApplication: gerbview\nVersion: (2018-01-26 revision 0d532b43d)-makepkg, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n    libcurl/7.54.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2l zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.23.1\nlibrtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.3 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.60.0\n    Curl: 7.54.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.1.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: gerbview","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-05T14:43:54.066Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T00:15:55.267Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T00:15:55.231Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["gerbview","priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1087157,"iid":12,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.0.0-rc2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-03T06:48:31.614Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:32:07.740Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1705","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1705","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1705/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1705/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1705","relative":"#1705","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1705"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27885120,"iid":1481,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Duplicate block does not show duplicated block (lp:#1747431)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1747431) created by **Dominik B (matyro)**\n```\nI am using prebuild KiCad nightly dc66b73a2 from the 02.02.2018 on Windows\n10\n\nWhen I duplicate a single element in Eeschema booth the duplicated element\nand the new (attached to my mouse) are displayed.
