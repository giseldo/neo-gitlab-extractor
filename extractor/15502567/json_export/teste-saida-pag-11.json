Only after I will close the symbol\nproperties dialog with OK button, and then will re-enter it (Edit\nproperties), I can update the fields with new part's properties.\nSeems like the OK button on the Symbol Properties dialog applies the\ncomponent change, and not just the selection of new component.\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema

Found two\nconfusing features. For example, deleting is simple by hovering the mouse\nbutton on a component / footprint and pressing delete button, the second is\nselecting an object and deleting it with the delete key. So it turns out\nthat I, for example, just selected via, edited its parameters. And I need\nto delete some track segment on the other end of the circuit board. I move\nthe mouse cursor over the track segment and press delete and oops - via\ndeletes. The problem is that I often notice that you can quietly remove\nsomething in this way.\n\nI think this will help:\n1. Make the priority of the object over which the mouse cursor is currently\nabove higher than the selected object (leave the selection itself).\n2. Or apply action ONLY on an object when mouse cursor under it. If object\nis selected, and it a part of selected group - action makes with whole\nselected group objects.\n\nIf you want to perform an action on selected objects, then the mouse must\nbe directed at one of them.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-01T15:57:26.293Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T22:03:49.677Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T13:53:36.912Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":24,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3140","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":20,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3140","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3140/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3140/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3140","relative":"#3140","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3140"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27929782,"iid":2789,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Text search/replace not producing visible change (lp:#1827240)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1827240) created by **Ron Burkey (rburkey)**\n```\nI have found a case in which a find \u0026 replace on text in a schematic\nproduces no visible results, and requires exiting eeschema and reloading\nthe schematic in order to view the changed text.\n\nSpecifically, I have a schematic in which one sheet consists of nothing but\ntables of textual information.

is missing a trace\nthat connects two pins located in different sheets.\nLooking at the attached images you can immediately notice that the\nREADER1_LED label is incorrect (it should be LED_READER1 following the same\nlogic as LED_READER2).\nAs you can see in another sheet there are the corresponding LED_READER1 and\nLED_READER2.\nOk my mistake, the label is wrong, but something is not right anyway since\nthe verification of individual labels is active among the DRC options.\nI would at least expect a Warning that the label is unpaired but also that\nR23 has one of the pins disconnected ....\n\nThe project was done with the version of eschema a few months ago but the\nverification fails even with this nightly ..\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.0-unknown-r15501-42d20cbd, debug

This is much\nharder to use than the Footprint Editor's filter box.\n\nThe Footprint Editor has much more flexible and powerful filter box.  It\nallows multiple search keys (and it doesn't care about the order of the\nsearch keys it receives).  I really like this filtering method!\n\n\n** Example **\nLets say I want to find the footprint \"DSUB-15-HD_Female_Horizontal\".\nusing Footprint Editor, I may search for \"female 15 dsub\" and find this\npart.  Here, the spaces are interpreted as separating my search keys.  So\nmy search keys are 'female', '15', and 'dsub'.  The order of the search\nkeys doesn't matter, which is VERY convenient.\nNow, if I try to search for the same part using the Assign Footprints\nfilter box, the previous search string would return 0 results.  Instead, I\nwould need to enter a search string such as this one:  \"dsub*15*female\".\nIn this case, the asterisks are treated as wild cards inside a SINGLE\nsearch key; therefore, I must enter 'dsub', '15', and 'female' in exactly\nthe correct order to see any search results.  This is much less convenient\nthat the search method that is being used in the Footprint Editor.\n\n\n** My proposed solution **\nMake the Assign Footprints filter box use the same search method employed\nby the Footprint Editor.\nThis would not require writing a new search function - just change Assign\nFootprints to use the existing (awesome) search function that the Footprint\nEditor has.\n\nI believe this change would make KiCad an even better program than it\nalready is.\nThank you for making KiCad such an amazing tool already!\nRyan Jensen\n\n\n** My version information **\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema feature.request ui","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-30T21:14:14.076Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T12:58:24.373Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T12:58:24.256Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","feature-request","priority::low","status::fix-committed","ui"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2948","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2948","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2948/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2948/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2948","relative":"#2948","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2948"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27929738,"iid":2787,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Latest nightly build not plotting text in schematic symbols (lp:#1827124)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1827124) created by **Ron Burkey (rburkey)**\n```\nHere are links to two image files created from almost identical schematics\n(an extra text string has been added to one of them, so they're not _quite_\nthe same).

(Also similar to AutoCAD)\n\nThank you.\n```\nOriginal tags: feature.request ui","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-30T18:06:58.210Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T14:22:58.051Z","closed_at":"2020-11-11T14:22:58.022Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["feature-request","priority::wishlist","status::opinion","ui"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2401","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2401","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2401/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2401/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2401","relative":"#2401","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2401"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27924592,"iid":2399,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Wishlist: pcbnew flag for \"footprint has no symbol on purpose\" (Prevents deletion on pcb from schematic update) (lp:#1827002)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1827002) created by **Rene Poeschl (poeschlr)**\n```\nRight now KiCad has no way to know if a footprint on a pcb has been added\nfor good reason without a symbol connected or if the symbol has been\ndeleted. For this reason all such footprints are deleted when the \"delete\nextra footprints\" flag is enabled.\n\nA good example for footprints that typically do not have a symbol are\nfootprints for graphical symbols (a company logo, the made with kicad logo,\nwarning ESD sensitive, QR codes, ...)\n\nRight now the only option is to lock such a footpirnt. This is both\ninconvenient and unintuitive.\n\nMy suggestion therefore would be a flag that only ensures the Delete extra\nfootprints flag does not delete that footprint. Possibly this flag could be\nset if a footprint is manually added to the PCB (or a popup could come up\nasking if they want to protect it. That popup would however benefit from a\n\"do not ask again\" flag)\n```\nOriginal tags:

board edge detection on round boards (lp:#1826630)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1826630) created by **Benoît Vernier (bvernier)**\n```\nHello,\n\nFirst of all, the bug I am experiencing is in KiCAD 5.1.2 (full version at\nthe end) and did not occur in 5.1.0, both on macOS 10.14.4 and downloaded\nfrom the official website.\n\nWhen using circles or arcs on the board outline in pcbnew, there is an area\nthat is incorrectly detected as being the board outline and it is\nimpossible to route traces in that area.\n\nVideo demonstrating: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFqVa8BtuPk. The board\nfile used for the video is attached.\n\nHow to reproduce?\n\n1) Create a new board in pcbnew.\n2) Create a circle on the Edge.Cuts layer.\n3) Route a trace outside of the circle (you won't be able to route it\ninside).\n4) Move the trace inside the circle using the Move tool.\n5) Try to move one of the extremities using the \"Drag (free angle)\" tool.\n6) The \"errors\" will be displayed.\n\n\nApplication: pcbnew\nVersion: (5.1.2-1)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.6.5 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.1\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin

When I want to create copper planes\nusing the right bar tool (below vias), I have a pop-up saying \" The legacy\nsegment fill mode is not recommended. Convert zone to polygon fill ?\".\n\nFirst I didn’t understand the message. I tried to google and browse the\ndoc, but did not found answers. Second, answering Yes or No, I can create\nthe copper plane, It gets hatched, but it does not connects the pads of the\nnet nor “fill”. I posted a message here:\nhttps://forum.kicad.info/t/v5-1-0-copper-plane-issue-legacy-segment-\nmode/16505\n\nI can't work my way forward:\n- new created copper zones get the alert message, and if Yes answered to\ntransform to polygon fill, the new zone is hatched, but not filled (and\npads not connected),\n- if I select all old copper zones and say YES to transform to polygon\nfilled zones, it stays the same,\n- if I delete all old copper zones, it stays the same,\n- if I create a new project from scratch, I can create copper zones that\nget filled.\n\nThe project I have issues with is located here:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/lql8beaw4nbdbu7/AAA6ybz4Hg-SazKWOdMgsZDda?dl=0\n\nI’m a newbee, so I can miss obvious things here. But I believe that with\n5.0, I already did the thing correctly.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJMF\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-22T09:00:54.140Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:21:23.244Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T19:07:52.944Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085265,"iid":3,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.3","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.3/+download/kicad-5.1.3.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.3/+download/kicad-5.1.3.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T14:12:22.308Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:30:15.472Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/3"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/179","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/179","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/179/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/179/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#179","relative":"#179","full":"kicad/code/kicad#179"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27924552,"iid":2390,"project_id":15502567,"title":"pcbnew: Add \"include locked objects\" checkbox to Move Exactly (lp:#1825768)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1825768) created by **Oleg Endo (oleg.endo)**\n```\nIf a single locked object is selected the \"move exactly\" operation becomes\nunavailable.  However, a regular move (with mouse/keyboard) is possible.\n\nWhen selecting multiple objects, incl. locked objects, \"move exactly\" is\navailable, but locked objects will be automatically unselected.\n\nThis behavior doesn't make sense, in my opinion.  It should be possible to\nmove locked objects with either operation.

is slow and renders with glitches on large design (lp:#1825268)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1825268) created by **Victor W (vicw)**\n```\nUsing a nightly version of pcbnew, we've noticed some substantial\nperformance degradation when working with a complex layout. In our case, we\nhave around 130k nets, and just over 13k pads, with 26 layers.\n\nWe're observing the following issues;\n\n1) Slow performance when scrolling or viewing design\n\nWhen scrolling around the board, it seems to take a really long time for\neverything to happen. Zooming in or out takes is really slow and laggy.\n\n2) Slow/laggy/inconsistent performance when routing traces.\n\nIn addition, pcbnew is very slow when routing tracks, it seems really\nlaggy, and it doesn't always work - it will look like you're routing a\ntrack, but when you try and finish it, it does not always appear or remain,\nand you have to do it over.\n\n3) Graphics glitches\n\nWhen changing views or layers, sometimes you get really weird artifacts,\ntearing, or glitches.\n\nThe best example is when alternating between \"show filled areas in zones\"\nand \"do not show filled areas in zones\".\n\nIf you toggle between the two, eventually things end up looking really\nfunny - maybe the wrong colour, or else an entire layer will disappear.\nThis also sometimes happens if you rapidly switch between high contrast\nmode (h) and regular mode. It also sometimes happens if you toggle between\ndrawing modes, especially fill zones and sketch zones.\n\n---\n\nI realize that this bug report is very qualitative, but the problem here is\nthat the behavior is really inconsistent. Sometimes it works, other times\nwe only belatedly realize that it's not showing all the pads for the front\nof the board.\n\nMost of the issues we're seeing did not exist with the release version of\nkicad v5.1.\n\n(With the release version, it's still a bit laggy, but nowhere nearly as\nbad as it is using the current git build).\n\nI see these problems using the following nightly version of kicad;\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0-293-g45aa51459), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.64.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1b zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.1.1 libpsl/0.20.2\n(+libidn2/2.1.1) libssh2/1.8.1 nghttp2/1.36.0\nPlatform: Linux 5.0.2-arch1-1-ARCH x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.64.0\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.1 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-18T01:18:17.370Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T11:33:50.120Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T11:33:50.082Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::medium","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5017256,"username":"twlostow","name":"Tomasz Wlostowski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a91a5ffaa6c2c9f88ccfbb53b8565162?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/twlostow"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5017256,"username":"twlostow","name":"Tomasz Wlostowski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a91a5ffaa6c2c9f88ccfbb53b8565162?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/twlostow"},"user_notes_count":9,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2779","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2779","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2779/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2779/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2779","relative":"#2779","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2779"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27937320,"iid":3175,"project_id":15502567,"title":"QFN wizard generates wrong pad sizes (lp:#1825261)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1825261) created by **Paul van der hoeven (paulvdh)**\n```\nVery recently (yesterday, 2019-04-17) a small bug was discovered in the QFN\nWizard script, and within a few hours jp-charras made a quick patch with:\nhttps://github.com/KiCad/kicad-source-\nmirror/commit/68e6308066a3bd0a4fcbf6aae8c4869d075aae3e\n\nHe renamed \"fillet\" to \"offset\" a few times, and removed the \"offset\" from\nthe pad length.\nThis is great, and I'm amazed by the fast response (I've seen this happen\nbefore with small and easy to fix things).\n\nAs a remnant from the (oddly weird) \"fillet\", the offset is now divided by\n2.\nIt seems more logical to add the complete offset the pads:\n\npcbnew/python/plugins/qfn_wizard.py\n102 -

Regions that should be completely filled end up looking torn and\njagged, and the resulting view is just wrong.\n\nI've attached a screenshot of this to the report.\n\nIf you try and work around this, by opening a small number of gerbers at a\ntime, and then incrementally adding more, it is still very slow. If we try\nand do this to open all 40, gerbview becomes unresponsive for a\nridiculously long time (\u003e3min), and then eventually puts up a progress bar\n(\"Loading Gerber Files...\").\n\nAfter about 30s of seeing the progress bar, all the rendering breaks again,\nand it looks like the attached screen shot.\n\n\n---\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0-293-g45aa51459), release

symbol on a schematic breaks a lot of eeschema features\nwhich as far as I know work fine prior to placing the text or symbol.  The\nonly workaround is to exit and reenter eeschema after you do that.  Placing\nwires still seems to work fine.  There's so much weird stuff randomly\nbroken, I can even describe it properly here.  I've made a video that runs\nthrough various things I've discovered, ineptly I'm afraid, since I have no\nmic and had to just type my commentary directly in the video.  (Sorry!)\n\nI believe there's probably a lot of other stuff similar to what's in the\nvideo that's broken, but this rev (the current nightly) has become\nessentially unusable for me, so I've had to move on to other things for\ntoday rather than continue trying to coax it to work.\n\nHere's a video link:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=15UqwiXn4BQdLzWk-\nYHgXJJ8lZmzlUBD5\n\nApplication:
