Thank you very\nmuch for adding them to the pcbnew!\n\nOne feature I miss though is solid area around pads and vias. Currently\npcbnew does good job by outlining perimeter of the fill area. However, in\ncase if hash lines are located far enough of each other the pad regions may\nsuffer from inconsistent and insufficient connection.\n\nAlso, it would be just wonderful if there will be an option to specify\nwidth of the outline. Thus it will look like a thermal relief options, but\njust doing the opposite job.\n\nTo show the issue please take a look to my schematic where pads 2, 3, 4,\nand 5, as well as bunch of vias around are asking for solid areas.\n\nThanks!\n```\nOriginal tags: feature.request pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-11T12:15:11.217Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T14:34:19.945Z","closed_at":"2020-08-07T14:33:19.326Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["feature-request","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2519","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2519","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2519/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2519/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2519","relative":"#2519","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2519"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27938260,"iid":3240,"project_id":15502567,"title":"GerbView assertion when opening multiple files (lp:#1847743)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1847743) created by **Mishka (mike-volokhov)**\n```\nHi,\n\nthe recent GerbView throws me assertion when I try to open multiple files\nat once.

Of course, instead of triangle it will create a line.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n1) Click on Add a filled zone (Alt+A).\n2) Click in the workspace.\n3) In the Copper Zone Properties dialog ensure the Constrain outline to H,\nV, and 45 degrees checkbox is enabled.\n4) Create a square.\n5) Observe a triangle with the very last point lost.\n\nMy KiCad version:\nApplication: Pcbnew\nVersion: (5.99.0-216-gf0b29de6e), debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.0.20 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.0\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 17.7.0 x86_64), 64 bit, Little endian, wxMac\nBuild Info:\n    Build date: Oct  9 2019 04:52:13\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,STL containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.54.0\n    Compiler: Clang 9.0.0 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n    KICAD_STDLIB_DEBUG=OFF\n    KICAD_STDLIB_LIGHT_DEBUG=OFF\n    KICAD_SANITIZE=OFF\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-11T10:28:26.265Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T08:29:17.603Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T12:08:44.325Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::undecided","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/668","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/668","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/668/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/668/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#668","relative":"#668","full":"kicad/code/kicad#668"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27938256,"iid":3239,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Stray lines on hatched fill zones (lp:#1847737)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1847737) created by **Mishka (mike-volokhov)**\n```\nHi,\n\nthe GerbView shows stray lines within the area of hatched fill zones.

Saving kicad_pcb file and reopening it\nwill result in inability to drag corners. At the same time edges can be\ndragged as usual.\n\nUnfortunately, this happens only to my schematics created in KiCad 5.1.\nLayouts created in KiCad 5.99 seem work fine after pcbnew reopening. I've\nattached the sample kicad_pcb file which reproduces the issue.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1) open the zonetest.kicad_pcb file\n2) try to drag zone corner; note it doesn't work\n3) drawe a new zone\n4) try to drag a corner of the new zone; note it does work this time\n5) save the file; close pcbnew; open pcbnew and load the file\n6) try to drag a corner of the new zone; note it does not work anymore\n\nVersion information:\n\nApplication: Pcbnew\nVersion: (5.99.0-216-gf0b29de6e), debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.0.20 zlib/1.2.11

PCB manufacturer, saying that he found\n“SameNetSpacing” issues in some filled copper zones of our KiCad project.\nThe filling algorithm seems to ignore the “min clearance” setting in some\nsituations. Please have a look to the screenshot I have uploaded to the\nkicad forum:\nhttps://kicad-info.s3.dualstack.us-\nwest-2.amazonaws.com/original/3X/3/7/37a1b457eca890be2f97d6353b78e27d9b44410a.png\n\n* Case A: the distance between the two vias shown on the left is 1049um,\nThe filling algorithm generates two stubs having a distance of 48um. The\nclearance setting was 152.4um (6mils)\n* Case B: the distance between the two vias shown on the right is smaller:\n880um. The distance between the two stubs is ok.\nThe annular ring and drill for all vias is exactly the same.\nThe \"SameNetSpacing\" issues can be solved if the vias are placed closer or\nfurther.\n\nEnclosed, there is a kicad project, demonstrating this behavour. When you\nmove the upper left GND via a bit closer or further to the other GND via\nand refill layer In2, the distance between the two lobes will be ok - only\nif this specific distance is used the problem will appear.\n\nFor further information, please have a look at the forum (also for\ndiscuttion if \"SameNetSpacing\" should be handled as error or not):\nhttps://forum.kicad.info/t/samenetspacing-issue-in-filled-copper-\nzones/19273\n```\nOriginal tags: feature.request pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-08T09:15:15.301Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T19:35:50.544Z","closed_at":"2021-12-24T12:36:06.542Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["feature-request","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1387731,"iid":16,"project_id":15502567,"title":"7.0","description":"Planning milestone for 7.0 issues","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-29T16:23:39.606Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T23:37:00.768Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/16"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2512","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2512","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2512/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2512/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2512","relative":"#2512","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2512"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27941733,"iid":3433,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Wishlist: Implementation of GIT and increase revision number (lp:#1847100)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1847100) created by **S2 (serkanxselcuk)**\n```\nHello Developers,\n\nThank you for awesome work on KiCad.\n\nI think it would be very helpful for PCB developers and KiCad librarian, if\nKiCad would include some GIT features on Project editor, EEschema, PcbNew,\nSymbol Editor, Footprint Editor and if applicable on GarberView.\n\nFeatures would be active, if GIT is installed on system.

(lp:#1846811)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1846811) created by **Piotr Gałka (piotrgalka)**\n```\nNot bug, but suggestion.\nI think it would be useful if thermal relief spoke width could be settable\nnot only at pad level but also at whole footprint level (or maybe at\nfootprint class level).\nIn footprint libraries probably all footprints has this width set to 0 for\nall pads. So user probably sets it after placing zones at PCB.\n\nGND zone connects to many 0402 blocking capacitors so for zone I set spoke\nwidth to 0.25mm.\nBut, among others, I have also 2x20 pin connector in which I assumed GND-\nSignal1-Signal2-GND-Signal3... to each signal have adjacent GND return\npath.\nI have to change spoke width for each GND pad. I found that I can copy-\npaste pad properties but it would be easier if:\n- I could select all pads inside footprint by mouse rectangle, or\n- just set it for whole footprint.\n\nWriting this I got idea how I will solve that. I will modify that width in\nmy footprint definitions.\n\nMay be in KiCad default libraries all bigger elements should have the spoke\nwidth defined.\n\nApplication: KiCad\nVersion: (5.1.4)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: feature.request pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-04T18:33:27.257Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T00:22:54.012Z","closed_at":"2020-05-14T00:20:22.658Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["feature-request","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2511","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2511","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2511/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2511/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2046"},"references":{"short":"#2511","relative":"#2511","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2511"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27918680,"iid":1820,"project_id":15502567,"title":"missing connection with multi-part components in different hierarchical sheets (lp:#1846803)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1846803) created by **Eberhard Seibel (cantor53)**\n```\nFirst, attached is the reference project test.zip.\nKicad shows a strange behavior when creating the connections (netlist)\nbetween eeschema and pcbnew. In the identical hierarchical drawings \"LED\"\non sheet T2.sch is in each case a part of a multi-part IC (here 74AUC2G00).\nNow the netlist visible in pcbnew:\nIn pcbnew only part B is connected. As an example, sheet Led0 and\nsheet5D88809D show the two related parts of U2. Port \"P0\" associated with\nsheet \"LED0\" is connected to part B of U2 used in sheet \"sheet5D88809D\"\ninstead of part A to \"Led0\". The output of U2B is again connected to the\ncomponent R3 from \"Led 0\". The connection \"P3\" has disappeared.\nThis behavior seems to be related to splitting a multi-part IC into\nmultiple designs.

Moved between schematic and PCB  NEW several\ntimes. Eventually got message that the .NET file could not be used as two\nICs had footprints could not be used as pins were missing. On checking  the\nschematic I found that the two ICs had SOIC 16 footprints declared (as I\nexpected), however PCBNEW considered that SOIC14 had been declared for\nboth.\n\nIn the schematic I re-selected SOIC16 for both. No success. Also I deleted\nthe .NET file then re-created it. No success.\n\nOther ICs were in the schematic but were not affected.\n\nPreviously a schematic with a collection of 14, 16 and  18 pin SOIC ICs had\nall changing to 8 pin SOIC after schematic editing.\n\nAm I doing something wrong, or is there a fault?\n\nPeter\n\nApplication: KiCad\nVersion: (5.1.4)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-03T12:33:37.030Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T12:59:38.852Z","closed_at":"2020-02-26T12:59:38.792Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["eeschema","pcbnew","priority::undecided","status::need-info"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2565","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2565","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2565/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2565/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2565","relative":"#2565","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2565"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27932477,"iid":2873,"project_id":15502567,"title":"pcbnew board file loading got very slow (lp:#1846438)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1846438) created by **Oleg Endo (oleg.endo)**\n```\nSince maybe about 2 months ago, the board file loading in pcbnew got really\nslow.

Top pad1 I left\nwithout offset, but all others smd pads use offsets to have their origin in\ntop pad1, or pad already connected that way with top pad1.\nWhen I put that footprint at PCB (project attached) I see pads not being\nconnected and connection lines pointing the pad graphic centers and not\ntheir origins.\nCompare KEY_1.png and KEY_2.png. When I connect track to right pad 1 origin\ntwo connection lines disappear. At first I supposed that at that moment\nthey were found to be connected (thanks to my offsets) but now I think that\nboth of them are found to be connected to track so they are connected also.\n\nI supposed connection lines would point to pad origins. And I think it\nshould work that way (if not then what for are the offsets in smd pads).\nBut what if someone use both X and Y offset and position origin out of pad.\nFirst thought is to not allow it in footprint editor. But in my footprint\nwould't it be logical to position all pad 2 origins in center of through-\nhole pad 2 making them being connected and at once making the connection\nline to point where the connection is expected to be done.\n\nApplication: KiCad\nVersion: (5.1.4)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11

tool\ncan give wrong result: different nets have the same name (/\u003cNO NET\u003e) and\nthey are highlighted even if they are not connected.\n\nSince \"no information\" is better than \"wrong information\", a simple\nsolution could be to not highlight the wires if the net name is \"/\u003cNO NET\u003e\"\n(and issue a warning).\n\nTo reproduce:\n1) Open a generic schematic (without net labels)\n2) Clear annotation\n3) Highlight a net: all nets get highlighted since all net names are \"/\u003cNO\nNET\u003e\"\n\nIn stable version 5.1.4 there is not this behaviour: it seems the nets are\nalways named (Something like Net-(R?1753720092-Pad2)) even if the schematic\nhas not been annotated, so there is no risk to see different un-connected\nnets highlighted at the same

report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1843700) created by **Dino Ghilardi (dino-ghilardi)**\n```\nIn master branch a python script can crash pcbnew.\n\nTested with ReplicateLayout plugin from\n\nhttps://github.com/MitjaNemec/Kicad_action_plugins\n\nTo replicate it:\n\n-Install the replicateLayout plugin\n-Open the attached project\n-Open pcbnew\n-Select R15\n-Tools-\u003eExternal Plugins-\u003eReplicate Layout\n-in the dialog in \"Hierarchy level select file5D...FA.sch\n-Click OK\n-Now the layout seems correctly replicated but exiting pcbnew (don't save)\nthere is a segfault.\nIf, after running the script you try to undo it with ctrl-z you can get\nsome other weird behaviour (like some new components without any label and\nnot selectable on the board).\n\n\nOn 5.1.2 and 5.1.4 stable versions the script seems to work correctly\n(although it needed some modifications since the \"Flip\" function in dev\nversion gets 3 arguments and in stable it did get two. May be overloading\nit with the old behaviour can help in not braking old scripts when V6 will\nbe released)\n\n\ngdb reports:\n\nThread 1 \"kicad\" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x00007ffff3b11078 in main_arena () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\n(gdb) backtrace\n#0  0x00007ffff3b11078 in main_arena () from /lib/x86_64-linux-\ngnu/libc.so.6\n#1  0x00007fffd34da849 in PICKED_ITEMS_LIST::ClearListAndDeleteItems() ()\nfrom /home/dinoghi/SANDBOXKICAD5/usr/bin/_pcbnew.kiface\n#2  0x00007fffd2e74e80 in\nPCB_SCREEN::ClearUndoORRedoList(UNDO_REDO_CONTAINER\u0026, int) () from\n/home/dinoghi/SANDBOXKICAD5/usr/bin/_pcbnew.kiface\n#3  0x00007fffd31b09c9 in BASE_SCREEN::ClearUndoRedoList() () from\n/home/dinoghi/SANDBOXKICAD5/usr/bin/_pcbnew.kiface\n#4  0x00007fffd2deb985 in PCB_EDIT_FRAME::Clear_Pcb(bool, bool) () from\n/home/dinoghi/SANDBOXKICAD5/usr/bin/_pcbnew.kiface\n#5  0x00007fffd2e1e5ef in PCB_EDIT_FRAME::OnCloseWindow(wxCloseEvent\u0026) ()\nfrom /home/dinoghi/SANDBOXKICAD5/usr/bin/_pcbnew.kiface\n#6  0x00007ffff634440e in wxAppConsoleBase::CallEventHandler(wxEvtHandler*,\nwxEventFunctor\u0026, wxEvent\u0026) const ()\n   from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#7  0x00007ffff64c9ea5 in\nwxEvtHandler::ProcessEventIfMatchesId(wxEventTableEntryBase const\u0026,\nwxEvtHandler*, wxEvent\u0026) ()\n   from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#8  0x00007ffff64c9f9b in wxEventHashTable::HandleEvent(wxEvent\u0026,\nwxEvtHandler*) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#9  0x00007ffff64ca34b in wxEvtHandler::TryHereOnly(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#10 0x00007fffd3462e99 in EDA_BASE_FRAME::ProcessEvent(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/home/dinoghi/SANDBOXKICAD5/usr/bin/_pcbnew.kiface\n#11 0x00007ffff64ca153 in wxEvtHandler::DoTryChain(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#12 0x00007ffff64ca435 in wxEvtHandler::ProcessEvent(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#13 0x00007ffff64ca1a7 in wxEvtHandler::SafelyProcessEvent(wxEvent\u0026) ()\nfrom /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#14 0x00007ffff6e57be7 in wxWindowBase::Close(bool) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_gtk2u_core-3.0.so.0\n#15 0x00007ffff634440e in wxAppConsoleBase::CallEventHandler(wxEvtHandler*,\nwxEventFunctor\u0026, wxEvent\u0026) const ()\n   from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#16 0x00007ffff64c9ea5 in\nwxEvtHandler::ProcessEventIfMatchesId(wxEventTableEntryBase const\u0026,\nwxEvtHandler*, wxEvent\u0026) ()\n   from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#17 0x00007ffff64c9f9b in wxEventHashTable::HandleEvent(wxEvent\u0026,\nwxEvtHandler*) () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#18 0x00007ffff64ca34b in wxEvtHandler::TryHereOnly(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#19 0x00007fffd3462e99 in EDA_BASE_FRAME::ProcessEvent(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/home/dinoghi/SANDBOXKICAD5/usr/bin/_pcbnew.kiface\n#20 0x00007ffff64ca153 in wxEvtHandler::DoTryChain(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#21 0x00007ffff64ca435 in wxEvtHandler::ProcessEvent(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#22 0x00007ffff6e562f8 in wxWindowBase::TryAfter(wxEvent\u0026) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_gtk2u_core-3.0.so.0\n#23 0x00007ffff64ca1a7 in wxEvtHandler::SafelyProcessEvent(wxEvent\u0026) ()\nfrom /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_baseu-3.0.so.0\n#24 0x00007ffff6dfb2df in wxMenuBase::SendEvent(int, int) () from\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwx_gtk2u_core-3.0.so.0\n#25 0x00007ffff6cdec1b in ??
