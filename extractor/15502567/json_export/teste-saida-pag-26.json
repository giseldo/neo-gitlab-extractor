I understand that there were some issues with this control on\nother platforms.  However, the current solution of removing tree view from\nall platforms has made the Linux version much harder to use.\n\nIf the tree view is not usable on Mac/MSW, then we should look at how to\nfix the problem for those platforms.  Removing functionality from Linux to\nfix a Windows problem is not a great solution.\n\nAt some point, the last time this was brought up, there were small text \"+\"\nexpanders added to the grid that, while not a full replacement for tree\nview, were at least usable.  I didn't notice when they were removed again\nbecause I don't use the dialog every day.  But they are gone now.  And the\ndialog is once again difficult to use for large, complex schematics.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc3-dev-7-gc9c9245e7), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.52.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2l zlib/1.2.8 libidn2/0.16 libpsl/0.17.0\n(+libidn2/0.16) libssh2/1.7.0 nghttp2/1.18.1 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.9.0-6-amd64 x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.62.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.52.1\n    Compiler: GCC 6.3.0 with C++ ABI 1010\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-09T19:22:41.062Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T00:14:42.110Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T15:55:33.958Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/117","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/117","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/117/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/117/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#117","relative":"#117","full":"kicad/code/kicad#117"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27875545,"iid":858,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Constraining the dimension tool doesn't constrain the number shown (lp:#1780826)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1780826) created by **Seth Hillbrand (sethh)**\n```\nWhen adding a dimension to the pcb, you can use Ctrl to limit the axes\nused.

Show either a small down arrow or\nup arrow at the right edge of the heading to indicate if it is sorted by\nthis column and whether the sorting is ascending or descending. The\nsequence will be like this: click a column heading once to sort ascending\n(increasing in alphanumerical order as you go *down*, as indicated by a\n*down-arrow* symbol), click a 2nd time to sort descending (decreasing in\nalphanumerical order as you go *down*, as indicated by an *up-arrow*\nsymbol), click a third time to stop sorting by this column and go back to\ndefault sorting, which is by Row Number (ascending in number as you read\ndown) The symbol for this will be a down-arrow symbol in the Row Number\ncolumn and either no symbols or a circle or dot symbol (developer's choice)\nin all other columns. Click a 4th time to start back over, repeating this\ncycle: ie: sort this column in ascending order again. Etc etc.\n\n   * Retain sorting information in such a way that clicking one column then\nanother does a multi-column priority sort. Ex: clicking \"Library Path\" then\n\"Description\" will sort first by Library Path, then re-sort by Description,\nbut if the description of many items is the exact same then they will still\nretain their previous sorting information by Library Path. This way, you\nwill see all items with the same Description grouped together, sub-sorted\nby Library Path. You get the idea.\n\n   * Retain sorting information for the life of the main KiCad window being\nopen, but once KiCad is completely closed and then re-opened, revert back\nto default sorting (by Row Number). This means that if the user opens the\nSymbol Library manager then sorts how they want it, then close it, the next\ntime they open it it will retain its previously-sorted configuration until\nthe user completely restarts KiCad, at which point it will revert to\ndefault sorting by Row Number.\n\n   * Allow user to re-number rows: Add a button called \"Re-number Rows\".\nWhen the user clicks it, it will bring up a pop-up window which says,\n\"Caution: all rows will be re-numbered from top to bottom as they are\nsorted now. This cannot be undone.

Since adding these pours, the time required\nfor PCBnew to load the design and become interactive has has gone up\ndrastically.\n\nPrior to adding these pours it took approximately 3min for PCBnew to load\nthe design and become responsive. The addition of these pours has resulted\nin PCBnew taking over 20min to load the design and become responsive.\n\nWe have also noticed a responsiveness difference when viewing the design\nwith filled zones showing, or with \"Do not show filled areas in zones\".\nGenerally speaking, the program is more responsive when the filled area is\nhidden.\n\nWe've tried running the program with the legacy, accelerated, and fallback\nmodes, but it's not clear that there is a substantial difference in the\ntime until it becomes responsive.\n\nAs it stands, the loading time make it incredibly difficult for

done on windows and linux but on OS X, KiCad\nis already behaving as a single application with multiple windows (except\nfor gerbview...), so I think shortcuts should behave accordingly for\nconsistency with most other applications.\n\nA shortcut which should not be overriden by KiCad is cmd-h, which is a\nsystem shortcut to hide the current application.\n\nAnother shortcut that is

To be honest, at the end PADS asks\nfor confirmation if you really want to combine the two nets but you could\nneglect the thing for the moment since at present kicad ignores the thing\n...\n\nAnother strange thing is that in \"size\" the widget expects a float but then\nthe following label specifies H(mm) x W(mm) which is not accepted.\nFinally if you resize the dialog vertically the labet \"Text:\" loses\nalignment with the entry widget.\n\nI know I'm a \"rompiscatole\" :-)\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.0.0-rc2-unknown-r13186-dd436b65, debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.59.0 OpenSSL/1.1.0h zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2\n(+libidn2/2.0.4) libssh/0.7.5/openssl/zlib nghttp2/1.32.0\nPlatform: Linux 4.16.16-300.fc28.x86_64 x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.66.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.59.0\n    Compiler: GCC 8.1.1 with C++ ABI 1012\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=OFF\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-23T10:38:46.530Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T08:17:59.014Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T08:17:58.961Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1144","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1144","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1144/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1144/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1144","relative":"#1144","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1144"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27876915,"iid":984,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema: Hierarchical sheet text fields clutters up when changing line thickness preferences (lp:#1778240)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1778240) created by **endofexclusive (endofexclusive)**\n```\nThis relates to how Eeschema displays the fields \"File name\" and \"Sheet\nname\" on a hierarchical sheet symmbol. Plotting the schematic does not have\nthese issues.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a hierarchical sheet\n2. Set the sheet field sizes for \"File name\" and \"Sheet name\" to 0.05 inch\n3. Change line thickness in the menu \"Preferences-\u003eGeneral options\" to 14\n\nWhat is happening:\n- The characters in the text start to grow into each other.\n- The text fields collide with the sheet symbol outline.\n\nWhat was expected:\nIt was expected that the line thickness preference should not affect the\nsheet text. Or possibly affect the text in a non-obfuscating manner.\n\nTwo patches have been prepared. The first patch clamps the text field\nthickness similar to how the plot operation does. The second patch improves\ncalculation of the text field placement, taking line widths and text sizes\ninto account.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-193-gdd436b658), release

PAD info from GerbView into Pcbnew,\ncan an option be added to the Export menu, to enables/disable 'Generate\nVias at PADS'.\n- ie an option to exports traces only, no flashed PADS.\n\n Right now, GerbView always exports round vias, hole included, even for SMD\nparts. That's close to worse than useless, as it actually hinders\ndownstream work (and is no use for immediate fab).\n\n In testing Pcbnew import, and the new WireIt plugins that allow Manual\nNetName addition it turns out the smart auto-reconnect of Traces(net 0) to\nPADS (net xyz) that is inbuilt, nicely helps re-create a board from\nGerbers, but it is hindered by those GerbView exported Vias, when those\nVias cause a violation (typically due to opposite side collisions not on\noriginal SMD design).\n\n\n Long term, GerbView needs to export FLASH codes as single PADS, using the\nDrill info if present. That will get close to FAB-Ready, if lacking\ncomponent intelligence. - but that's more work...\n\n This is for a short term, easy menu fix, to allow users to better control\nwhat is exported.\n\nSee also discussion here https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1748529\nfor the more advanced GerbView Flash -\u003e PAD Shapes export, and suggested\nexamples of how to manage that.\n```\nOriginal tags: gerbview","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-06-22T06:59:34.784Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T21:21:44.377Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T21:21:37.485Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["export","gerbview","priority::wishlist","status::resolved"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2160","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":14,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2160","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2160/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2160/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2160","relative":"#2160","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2160"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27876905,"iid":982,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Replace obscure english use of \"edition\" (lp:#1778168)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1778168) created by **Seth Hillbrand (sethh)**\n```\nThere was a discussion recently about what KiCad meant by the tooltip\n\"useful after a manual pad netname edition\".

a layer system in EEschema\nwhich may be used to highlight parts of the schematic.\n\nLet's say that you work on an acquisition device which have :\n - An input stage with protections\n - A filtering stage\n - A computing stage (for example a MCU)\n\nYou should put all \"input stage\" parts and wires on a layer,\n --  ---    --  -- \"filtering stage\" parts and wires on another layer\n and so on.\n\nThen, when you select a layer, it would highlight all parts/wires related\nto this layer.\n\nThis may be useful for complex schematics (and the ongoing update of\neeschema to GAL will probably allow this feature development)\n\nBest regards,\nJulien FAUCHER\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema

only after selecting\nthe F.CrtYd layer, selecting other layer keeps the F.CrtYd layer on top of\nF.Cu.\nThe B.CrtYd layer is always drawn on top of the B.Cu layer, no need to\nselect B.CrtYd first.\n\nF.SilkS, B.SilkS, Dwgs.User (used to define specify keepout areas in\nfootprints) are drawn behind copper layer unless they are selected.\n\nI don't know if it is a good idea to always draw the silkscreen layers on\ntop of copper layers but I think that the CrtYd and Dwgs.User layers\nshould, as they help positioning the components on the board and to define\nthe real keepout

Now I have to open the properties\ndialog and set both new x-size and new location, either after doing some\ncalculation or by entering a formula which I have to remember. Even before\nthat I have to think about the coordinates or size and remember it while I\nedit the properties.\n\nOn the contrary, zones don't have such properties but are edited with\nWYSIWYG principle. With a square zone I can just select the zone, grab the\nwhite ball (resize handle) and drag. Maybe something similar could be done\nwith pads?\n\nI don't think identical to zones would be the best option. If the resize\nhandles appear every time a pad is selected it would look messy and would\nlead to accidental resizings and difficulties in moving pads (which is\nprobably more common situation than editing their size). Maybe it would be\nbetter to have a context menu item \"Resize\" which would select the pad,\nshow the handles and allow resizing.\n\nThe behavior should of course be a bit different from zones - it would\nallow dragging only along the axis of the pad (like Control+drag with\nzones). Dragging from a corner wouldn't be necessary in my opinion, two\nconsecutive drags in two directions would do that if needed.\n\nThis possibility would make KiCad feature set more consistent with itself:\n1. Zones can be edited in this way, pads not, even though pads are also\ngeometrically polygons.\n2. Pads can be moved WYSIWYG, so X/Y coordinates can be edited WYSIWYG but\nX/Y size can't.\n```\nOriginal tags:

reference swap does not change copper zone net (lp:#1774967)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1774967) created by **Patrik Bachan (xorly)**\n```\nHi,\nhere is simple way to reproduce this bug:\n- let's have Schematic with symbols J1 and J2, both already in PCB\n- attach copper zone to any pad, eg. Net-(J1-Pad1)\n- Swap J1 and J2 references in schematic and update PCB (match by\n_timestamp_)\n\nCurrent behavior:\nCopper zone remains attached to Net-(J1-Pad1) and breaks connection from\npad, because pads' net changed from Net-(J1-Pad1) to Net-(J2-Pad1)\n\nExpected behavior:\nCopper zone should be attached to Net-(J2-Pad1), because only references\nchanged, FPs stayed in place. (Same behavior as traces have)\n\n\nThis happens only when you swap references, if you change reference to\nsomething unique, copper zones net is changed and everything is OK.\n\nIf you use netlabel to name net you attach copper zone to, there is no\nreference in net name and thus everything is OK.\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-rc2-dev-683-gc8f4e1051), release build\nLibraries:\n
