the\nconnection point starts moving within certain limits.

An easy solution would be to\njust allow adding any signal by name via a text entry. This could then\nauto-complete to the available net names, but also allow names that are\n*not* in the list of nets, such as `AB` above. It would also greatly speed\nup the process of adding signals instead of having to scroll through all\nthe auto-named `Net-(Device-PadN)` signals.\n\nAs can be seen in the above forum post, I did found a trick to have custom\nvectors show up, by adding a global netlabel using the same name, connected\nto a dummy resistor. This works, but is a work-around, and has the problem\nthat those curves are not updated when you change values in the schematic\nand re-run the simulation. One has to either close and re-open the plot\nwindow, or re-add the signals again.\n\nIn any case, this shows that such functionality would be an easy add!\nUnfortunately I haven't managed to compile kicad on macOS, otherwise I'd\ngive it a go myself :)\n\nApplication: Eeschema\nVersion: (5.1.5-rc1-4-g47deb8dea), debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.6.5 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.1\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 18.5.0 x86_64), 64 bit, Little endian, wxMac\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,STL containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.54.0\n    Compiler: Clang 9.0.0 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=ON\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema ngspice ui","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-05T12:54:02.429Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:36:09.002Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T14:36:08.957Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","ngspice","priority::undecided","status::fix-committed","ui"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3248","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3248","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3248/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3248/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3248","relative":"#3248","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3248"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27938340,"iid":3247,"project_id":15502567,"title":"simulator plot window duplicate colors (lp:#1851372)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1851372) created by **Jonatan Liljedahl (kymatica)**\n```\nIn the built in simulator plot window, after removing some signals and\nadding new ones, sometimes it reuses one of the colors already present.\nThis makes it impossible to know which curve is which.

I\nfind that if I 'anchor' the track it will stay grid aligned, but for\nexample if I move the cursor so that the router routes the track between\npads of a SOIC IC, for example, the track won't be grid aligned (though it\nwill pass a DRC check). I can't find an option to constrain the router to\nthe current grid.\n\nApplication: Pcbnew\nVersion: (5.1.4-0-10_14), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.6.5 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.1\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 18.7.0 x86_64), 64 bit, Little endian, wxMac\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,STL containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.54.0\n    Compiler: Clang 9.0.0 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=ON\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-31T18:12:55.047Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T21:13:14.267Z","closed_at":"2019-12-05T21:13:13.989Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","router","status::as-designed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3438","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3438","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3438/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3438/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3438","relative":"#3438","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3438"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27938323,"iid":3245,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Gerber file save option \"Exclude PCB edge layer from other layers\" generating \"Warning this file has no D-Code definition\" error message.

any component (tested with \"R\", \"L\" and \"L_Core_Ferrite\" thus far\nand all are affected)\n* Rotate a few times\n* Undo as many times\n* Rotate many times again\n\n*Expected behavior:*\nComponent rotates about it's origin and the texts stay close to the\ncomponent\n\n*Actual behavior:*\nThe component origin changes pseudorandomly(!) and the texts are displaced\nrelative to the component\n\nApplication: Eeschema\nVersion: 5.99.0-unknown-a3229c4~100~ubuntu18.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.58.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4

But I got there ask\nto report a new bug.\n\nFor me it looks that a sorting key function was changed to fix those bug,\nbut if that key function is used in construction ret.sort(...) it works\ncorrect but when used in construction sorted(g, ...) works incorrect.\nThe older version of that key function also worked correctly in first\nconstruction and not correctly in second.\n\nHere is the text I have written there:\n\n5.1.4 stable Win 7\n*.py files dated 2019-08-10 17:13:08\nI have noticed today that bom_csv_grouped_by_value_with_fp.py don't sorts\ncorrectly.\nIt is even not a alphabetic sort.\nI get the following sequence:\n\nC1, C2, C3, C4, C30, C31, C32, C23, C21, C22, C13, C8, C7, C33, C35\n\nI absolutelly don't know Python.\nDuring:\nhttps://forum.kicad.info/t/to-exclude-virtual-footprints-from-bom/19410\nI ended with replacing in my (little modified) copy of\nbom_csv_grouped_by_value_with_fp.py\ngropued = net.groupComponents()\nwith\ngrouped = net.groupComponents(net.getInterestingComponents())\nand noticed that except expected elimination from BOM elements marked with\nNU in field Installed I also get elements sorted correctly.\nIn getInterestedComponents() there is used ret.sort(...) and\nin groupComponents() there is used g = sorted(g, ...) with the same\nfunction sortKey.\nI don't know if that are two different sorting algorithms or two ways of\ncalling the same.\n\nSo I ended with double sorting - first with ret.sort(...) and next with g =\nsorted(g,...) and getting the correctly sorted elements.\n\nA moment ago I replaced in kicad_netlist_reader.py in function\ngroupComponents the line:\ng = sorted(g, key=lambda g: sortKey(g.getRef()))\nwith:\ng.sort(key=lambda g: sortKey(g.getRef()))\nand it looks that groupComponents alone (without getInterestedComponents)\nsorts references correctly.\nI don't know if what I have done is save from Python point of view.\n\nI think that it is good idea to eliminate uninstalled elements (like holes,\nbut not only) from BOM so I think the functionality of\ngetInterestedComponents() should be by default present in\nbom_csv_grouped_by_value_with_fp.py and others.\nMy first idea was to eliminate elements having footprint with Fabrication\nAttributes set to Virtual.\nI'm not sure - may be it is simpler/better then adding extra field\n\"Installed\" and give it a value \"NU\".\n\nApplication: KiCad\nVersion: (5.1.4)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema python","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-10-17T09:53:00.825Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T12:24:58.940Z","closed_at":"2020-04-05T12:13:57.859Z","closed_by":{"id":4725252,"username":"stambaughw","name":"Wayne Stambaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4725252/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stambaughw"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::low","python","starter","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1089112,"iid":1,"group_id":6593436,"title":"5.1.6","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-04T21:52:01.161Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T20:53:48.818Z","due_date":null,"start_date":"2019-11-27","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/kicad/code/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1940","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1940","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1940/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1940/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1940","relative":"#1940","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1940"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27807285,"iid":110,"project_id":15502567,"title":"No dots on implicit junctions in a schematic (lp:#1848450)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1848450) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nIn https://forum.kicad.info/t/nets-have-gone-haywaire/19418 Sparky_Labs had\na situation where there were several junctions in a schematic which didn't\nhave visible dots. That lead confusingly to combined nets. The project is\nattached. More information is available in the forum discussion.

For\ninstance I want to place a rectangle on F.CrtYd that is 0.15 mm bigger than\nthe rectangle on F.SilkS.\n\nCurrently I have to do this:\n-Draw 4 lines on F.CrtYd.\n-double click on each one, and then edit the line segment properties\n\nWhat I would like to do is:\n-Draw one diagonal line on F.CrtYd.\n-Double-click on that line, edit the endpoints so the 2 points are 0.15mm\noff grid.\n-Enter draw a line mode, and snap on the off-grid endpoint. Now the cursor\nsnaps on the grid, so I see a straight line that starts from the off grid\npoint, and end on a grid point. The line is now not a 90 or 45 degree\nangle.\n-Press CTRL. Now the line is restricted to vertical, 45 degrees and 90\ndegrees. For a vertical line, the cursor snaps vertically on the grid, but\nnot to the horizontal grid, so it can land on coordinate x=10.15,y=12.00\n-When the user makes a vertical line using the ctrl key with x=10.15 and\nthen goes near a horizontal line where y=13.45, the cursor should then also\nsnap to x=10.15,y=13.45\n\nI think the footprint editor can snap by default on objects in the current\nlayer, and optionally snap on objects on all layers. This can create a\nproblem when there an object that is very close to the grid. If the user is\nzoomed out, should the cursor snap on the grid, or on the object? If the\nuser is zoomed in, there's no problem, the user can just see what he is\nsnapping to. Can a user choose this by pressing a key like shift or alt?\n\nVersions:\nApplication: ModEdit\nVersion: (5.99.0-223-ge291576c3-dirty), debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.66.0
