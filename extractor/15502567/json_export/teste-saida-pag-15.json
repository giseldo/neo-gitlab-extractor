This appears to be a regression, as version\n5.0.2 does the connection bubble as expected.\n\nSee attached .gif of the issue.\n\nTo recreate the issue:\n1) Create a symbol that has it's \"Convert\" form with a pin at a different\nlocation from the original non-Convert symbol\n2) Add symbol to schematic\n3) Change symbol to convert form\n4) Try to connect wire to pin that is in a different location\n5) Observe connection bubble not show connection\n\nIt appears Eeschema thinks the pin is in the location of the non-Convert\nform, see the .gif.\n\nAdditional note: After closing and re-opening Eeschema, the improper bubble\ndisplay connection is fixed (until you do another Convert on the same\nsymbol).\n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.1.0-rc1-42-ga246d905f), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.3.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-02-16T00:39:46.868Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T00:18:15.634Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T22:57:20.634Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::fix-released"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/521","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/521","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/521/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/521/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#521","relative":"#521","full":"kicad/code/kicad#521"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27815573,"iid":520,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Wishlist: Double-clicking open FP filters in Symbol Editor (lp:#1816182)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1816182) created by **Evan Shultz (evan-shultz)**\n```\nIn the Library Symbol Properties dialog of Symbol Editor, one can click on\nthe Footprint Filters tab and see all FP filters.

\u003e Units allows selection of Imperial or Metric units.\n\nSymbol Editor, however, does not have a corresponding selection.

So\nthere's no way to select the units of the tool as a whole plus the user\nmust do conversion to reconcile the mixed units.\n\nMaking this more difficult, as a librarian, is that most of KLC uses mils\nas a unit.

PCB with two layers: normal features on F.Cu and some text off to\none side on (say) Cmts.User (eg attached PCB)\n2) Print the PCB at a higher scale (say 5), selecting only F.Cu in the\nprint dialog\n3) The output will have the bounding box of the whole PCB, including the\ncomment layer (which isn't shown)\n4) This means it is difficult to print just the bit you wanted at a higher\nscale centred in a page.\n\nI suggest there should be an option to use the bounding box of only the\nlayers selected in the print dialog (rather than the current behaviour of\nusing the bounds of ALL layers, printed or not).\n\nThis must be an option, as it's still useful to be able to print different\nlayer stackups with identical alignments.\n\n----\n\nApplication: pcbnew\nVersion:

Screenshot attached in next post.\n\nHowever, the names of the plugins are rather messy and not easy to visually\nparse with so many default entries and so many underscores. The word\n\"nickname\" conjures up an easy and simple way to reference some object, but\nthat word doesn't agree with my reaction when seeing this dialog.\n\nThe current use of \"nickname\" is actually the file name of the BOM\ngenerator tool. Newly-added plugins can be give a pretty name, but the\nexisting ones use the file name for the \"nickname\". It is relevant to show\nthe file name, even if just in the lower \"Command Line\" text box. But\nthere's nowhere on the dialog which has an appealing name for the plugin.\n\nPerhaps the dialog should use \"nickname\" (or some other nomenclature since\nthat is word being used already in the dialog) to refer to the plugin in a\nway that is visually more attractive even if the user didn't add the plugin\nmanually and give it a pretty nickname? For example, if no pretty name is\ngiven perhaps just replace underscores (and hyphens?) with spaces and\ncapitalize letters after word breaks? Or something. That would clean up the\nexisting dialog and default plugins while fitting in with plugins that are\nadded manually later where users have a choice to keep the file name or\ninstead enter a pretty name.\n\nGrouping BOM plugins (by output file format, by ECAD tool, etc.) may be\nbeneficial as well, but that may be too subjective to implement.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion:

I will\nattach to this bug a few archived simulation circuits to help illustrate\nthe items below. Hopefully these suggestions would flesh out the simulation\ncapability of KiCad and help many users. Some have been taken from\nhttps://github.com/KiCad/kicad-symbols/issues/418.\n\nI realize this is quite a number of items and I can separate them into\nunique bugs if desired. Since they do form a theme, at least to me, I'm\nsubmitting them together.\n\nThe circuits attached here (and others I've created, if you're interested),\nare available if you'd like to include them with KiCad as demos. I'm happy\nto update the existing simulation demos to use more attractive and\nstandardized symbols (including the sources I submitted at\nhttps://github.com/KiCad/kicad-symbols/pull/1473) as well as show off\nmeasurements and other features which may not be obvious.\n\n- [x] Support more SPICE directives (see\nhttp://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf, and also referenced\nbelow):\n.op (displays \".op: no such command available in ngspice\" even though it's\non page 258)\n.control (see page 295 of the manual; seems to have no effect but maybe I'm\ndoing it wrong)\n.plot (see manual page 275 but seems to have no effect; maybe I'm doing it\nwrong)\n.print (see manual page 274 but seems to have no effect; maybe I'm doing it\nwrong)\n.probe (see manual page 276 but seems to have no effect; maybe I'm doing it\nwrong)\n\n- [ ] Allow multiple plots to be shown at once. Often one will want to see\nsets of waveforms correlated on the X axis but broken up into multiple\nplots. This avoids blowing out the scale if one waveform is 1V peak and\nanother is 100V peak. Or if there are simply too many waveforms to be\neasily understood if they're shown at once. Or if it's logical to break up\nthe waveforms into groups. It is not common (in my experience with multiple\nSPICE simulators) to only allow a single plot to be shown at once for just\nthis reason.\n\n- [ ] Add a measurement pane in the Spice Simulator window near the plot area\nso measurements can be easily viewed and correlated with waveforms. This is\nespecially important when the simulation is stepped so the measurements can\nshow differences between each step that may be hidden by nearly overlapping\nwaveforms. LTSpice IV places measurements in the SPICE Error Log which is\nhard to find and must be opened after the simulation completes. Every.\nSingle. Time. Ugh. See included \"measurement_pane.png\" for a nice example\nof how this can be done in another simulator; below the plot you will see\n10 steps in the simulation and 12 measurements performed at each step.\n\n- [x] Instead of a fixed list of signals that can be plotted, allow signal\nnames to be added by typing them in. This is often faster for users that\nknow the syntax. If I connect a non-polarized component \"backwards\", like a\nresistor, plotting \"-I(R4)\" is easier that editing the schematic to flip\nR4's pins. It would also allow plotting a differential signal between any\ntwo nets, with other simulation tools using \"v(\u003cnet1\u003e,\u003cnet2\u003e)\" syntax.\nPerforming simple math functions, such as \"v(out)/10\" to show the output\nvoltage at 1/10th the real value in amplitude, is another reason (easy\nscaling/comparison with other signals on the same plot). Having a GUI to\ncreate differential signals and scaled signals would work, but typing in\nsignals is quick and easy and doesn't depend on a GUI to be created.\n\n- [~] _Provide other signal types besides just voltage and current. Power\n(\"w(\u003cref des\u003e)\"), logarithm (for example \"db(v(\u003cnet\u003e))\"), etc. are all\ncommon and powerful signal types that one may want to plot. This relates to\nthe above item as these signals types are neither listed nor can be\nmanually typed in._\n\nMoved to https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/6985.\n\n- [~] Clicking on a signal name (or hovering over it) in the Signals pane and\npressing Delete should remove the signal. Similarly, clicking on a cursor\nand pressing Delete should remove that cursor.\n\n- [~] The command \"Hide Signal\" actually deletes a signal. Actually \"hiding\" a\nsignal would no longer show the signal in a plot (or perhaps dim it) but\nsave the signal so it to be made visible again later. This is a useful\nfeature and I would like to see \"Hide Signal\" do what it says on the tin\nand add a true \"Delete Signal\" command as well. This nomenclature\nopaqueness also is present with cursors.\n\n- [~] A huge amount of real estate could be saved if a legend of the plotted\nsignals were shown inside the plot. This would better correlate color with\nsignal name by putting them physically closer together in the window and\nfurthermore eliminate the entire Signals section of the Spice Simulator\nwindow. This would be similar to the View \u003e Show Legend feature but make\nthis an integrated part of the plot window instead of a small overlay which\nconsumes some of the plot area and only duplicates information.\n\n- [~] _There is no need for \"Voltage\" on the top left and \"Current\" on the top\nright of every plot if only one unit is being used. This relates with the\nitems above about being able to perform math functions on signals which\nwould result in other units and supporting other signal types (power, dB\nvoltage, etc.)._\n\n- [x] It is not clear what cursor belongs to what signal. Perhaps the cursors\ncould stay with a dashed style but pick up the color of the associated\nsignal?\n\n- [~] _Add seek functions for cursors, finding the nearest peak, nearest\nvalley, max, min, etc. This is common in other SPICE simulators._\n\nMoved to: https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2321\n\n- [x] White is one of the colors for a signal. As the plot grid and labels\nare white, and also the background of the Signals pane, this is a poor\ncolor choice. White signals are still visible in the plot window, at least,\nbut in the Signals pane a white color swatch completely disappears.\n\n- [~] _There is no correlation between plotted signals and the schematic. It\nwould be helpful to indicate plotted nets, perhaps by adding some symbol or\nicon to the net (or part in the case of power) with the color of the signal\nin the visible plot._\n\nMoved to: https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/11254\n\n- [x] It is common to print DC bias point voltages and currents on the\nschematic for each net after simulation. This is not possible in KiCad now.\nOften I see it as floating text box with a line to the net/component, or as\na small bubble embedded into the net. This is quite helpful for voltage\ndividers and other simple circuits where only DC voltages and currents are\nneeded since it allows performing the simulation and seeing the results in\none place (not having to go to the Simulation window). A way to re-run the\nsimulation from within Eeschema would be needed to fully realize this item. https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/11253\n\n- [x] Save the open plot(s) + signal(s) when the simulator is closed and open\nthe same plot(s) + signal(s) after the next simulation. This would help if\nthe simulator is closed or if the project is sent to someone else so they\ncan jump in right away, seeing the waveforms the previous person had\nconfigured. This feature should be an option so viewing the previous\nplots/signals can be turned on or off with it defaulting to turned on.\nDone, workbooks cover this. \n\n- [x] Allow saving of plot(s) + signal(s) to an external file for recall\nlater. This will allow setting up a series of plots and waveforms and then\nrecalling them in groups as desired. It's often helpful to have some\nlogical groups of plots and signals in those plots. This would also help\nwith the above item as these could be recalled upon launching the\nsimulation, or when sharing data with another person.\nDone, workbooks cover this. \n\n- [ ] It does not appear that any possible \"\\\u003cident\u003e\" can be used in a .param\nstatement (see page 54 of the ngspice manual for info about this\nstatement). There is some conflict if a reserved \\\u003cident\u003e is used (like \"dc\"\nwhich does not converge; see in my precision_rectifier project where I\ncalled one param \"vdc\" since \"dc\" didn't work). It would be most helpful if\nKiCad could address this under-the-hood so the user can choose any \\\u003cident\u003e\nthey desire.\n\n- [ ] Combine colors on a plot when waveforms overlap. Currently, if two\nwaveforms lay on top of each other for any distance along the X axis one\nwaveform will be covered up and completely invisible. This is required, of\ncourse, if the points are printed to the same pixels on the display and not\nif the points are exactly identical.\n\n- [~] _Using the .meas SPICE directive requires putting a forward slash (\"/\")\nin front of the net name if the net has a label. See the diff_amp\nsimulation I attached. While this is shown in the UI (for example \"V(/out)\"\nin the Signals section of the Spice Simulator window), it's not obvious and\nmeans the text typed when creating the label doesn't match the text typed\nwhen referencing the label in a measurement.  This is required as the label can appear on more than one included sub-page, in which case it will have the subpage before it in the path string._\n\n- [x] Display node voltages in SI units instead of exponential format with\nthree significant digits (such as \"5.72449e+005\"). Showing \"u\" (or the\nactual Greek letter mu), \"m\", \"k\", \"M\"/\"Meg\", etc. is much more clear if a\nuser really needs to dig into this part of the simulation output, and for a\nbias point simulation this is the most salient way to understand the\ndesired result.\n\n- [ ] If repeated analysis isn't supported, implement it and add a GUI to\nconfigure it. This is a critical part of any simulation tool and is sorely\nmissed. I've often integrated repeated analysis with using measurements as\ndescribed in item 3 above. Creating steps in ngspice using the .control\ndirective is painful, if it even works (maybe I'm doing it wrong in the\nprecision_rectifier or high_side_v_i_converter simulations?). Apparently\nngspice doesn't support the easy .step directive for repeating the\nsimulation with some variation (page 295 of the manual).\n\n- [x] The included version of ngspice isn't anywhere I can find. Not printed\nin the console during a simulation and not in Help \u003e About. As updates are\nreleased regularly, knowing the included version with KiCad would be\nimportant in some cases. For example,\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/ngspice/feature-requests/33/ shows that a feature\nwas added to ngspice based on a user request/issue but then how does one\nknow if that feature is available in KiCad without knowing the ngspice\nversion? I see \"\u003cKiCad install location\u003e\\lib\\ngspice\" that looked\npromising, but the files in that folder don't look like an executable that\nI could query from a command line (and that's not really the point of this\nrequest anyway).\n\n- [x] It seems all pieces of text are passed to ngspice as parameters (the\nprecision_rectifier simulation has several instances of \"\u003c: no such command\navailable in ngspice\" in the output). Only text strings that start with a\nperiod, and hopefully any new line even if it's within a block of text,\nshould be recognized as spice directives.\n\n- [~] _The simulation output at the bottom left of the Spice Simulator window\nhas lots and lots of information. Most of it isn't helpfully for a properly\nconfigured and working simulation. I would think just putting error\nmessages and actual output (like measurements and bias point info) is best\nand then hiding the rest of the info. Simulation \u003e Show SPICE netlist takes\na similar approach by allowing the user to see what's going on but not\ninundating them with it each simulation run. Having separate areas for\n\"under the hood\" and \"the user wants to see this\" info may clean things up\nand would certainly make it easier to find the desired output in all the\ntext displayed._\n\n- [x] I find it convenient to paste a model or subcircuit as text onto the\nschematic canvas and then use that for simulation rather than having a\nseparate file with the model/subcircuit. Using text on the schematic also\nimproves portability. While it appears that the SPICE netlist includes a\nmodel/subcircuit if I place text on the scheamtic page, I'm not able to\nmake this work. If I leave the Si2304 subcircuit text in the\nhigh_side_v_i_converter simulation I see a variety of problems (an error\nmessage about a vector that I didn't record, \"Error: there aren't any\ncircuits loaded.\", KiCad simply crashing, the simulation completes but the\nnode voltages change, etc.) that go away when the text is removed. In the\nsimple_transistor simulation I know the symbol is picking up the text on\nthe schematic because I chose the 2N3904 symbol from the existing\nTransistor library and if I change the text of the model name (say to\n\"a2n3904\") I see an error message (\"Error on line 5 :\\q1 0 /npn_on_b\n/npn_on_c 2n3904\\could not find a valid modelname\"). LTspice, for example,\nrecognizes models pasted onto the schematic (even supporting \"+\" for a\nmulti-line model) but not subcircuits.\n\n```\nApplication: kicad\nVersion:

Either there needs to be a rename option or when\nyou copy a symbol there should be an offer to assign a new part number.\n\nI am using KiCad 5.0.2.\n\nMy other pet peeve is in the footprint filter there's no way to browse, but\nI understand a fix for this is in the works.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-30T07:11:27.880Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:14.572Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T22:51:30.135Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/492","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":12,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/492","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/492/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/492/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#492","relative":"#492","full":"kicad/code/kicad#492"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27919199,"iid":1869,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Unsupported Eagle layer vRestrict on import (lp:#1813680)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1813680) created by **Ed Cernek (ed-cernek)**\n```\nI am using kicad-5.0-unified-20190115-014504-4aeef1e09.dmg, which may be\nbeta.
