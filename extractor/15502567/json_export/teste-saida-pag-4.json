to report it as a bug as it is the effect of my\nmanipulations against the KiCad logic.\nSee attached screenshot - many IC pins are not connected and reason is not\nthat something is not in raster.\nI have changed the name of library containing W5500. Then when opening the\nschematic I didn't agree to rescue it. I wont to have all elements from\nlibraries (in future no elements will disappear from them).\nThe end effect was question mark in square. I clicked 'E' at it and changed\nthe library reference to point to right symbol again. And effect you see.\nI suppose that at the stage of question mark wire segments were connected\nto be one, and when symbol get back were not divided at its pins.\n\nI'm not sure if it really needs be fixed.\n\nApplication: KiCad\nVersion: (5.1.4)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-06T10:26:55.263Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T13:00:21.050Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T13:00:18.665Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::medium","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1816","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1816","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1816/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1816/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1816","relative":"#1816","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1816"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27807267,"iid":107,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema - 'symbol fields'-editor  - linebreak in a component field makes schematic unreadable  (lp:#1842943)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1842943) created by **Otto Mikkonen (ottomaani138)**\n```\nWhen working with the new 'symbol fields'-editor in eeschema, I've\nexperienced a breakage of the associated .sch-file due to linebreaks\nappearing on one of the component-fields.\n\nI'm not exactly sure from where these linebreaks appear, but they somehow\nmake their way into the fields when copying component field-data from one\npart to another. Somehow selecting a field graphically and copy-pasting it\nto another sometimes selects a hidden linebreak, which then partially\nbreaks the associated .sch file. Could also be, that the linebreak\noriginates from an external source, like the part# from mouser.com.\n\nAnyways, since these linebreaks can be so disastrous, I thought some added\nresilience to how fields are managed would be neat. I.e., when linebreak is\nencountered on a component field, it could be filtered out before saving\nthe .sch or something. I can't imagine a case, when linebreak is actually\nwanted on a component field.\n\nI added a screenshot on how the error-messages might look like when trying\nto open up a broken schematic.\n\n## VERSION INFO ##\n\nApplication: Eeschema\nVersion: 5.1.4-e60b266~84~ubuntu18.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.58.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libpsl/0.19.1\n(+libidn2/2.0.4) nghttp2/1.30.0 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.15.0-60-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 3.22\n    Boost: 1.65.1\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.58.0\n    Compiler: GCC 7.4.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema fields symbol","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-05T15:48:01.725Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:16:12.542Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T15:44:57.055Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::high","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085268,"iid":4,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.5","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.5/+download/kicad-5.1.5.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.5/+download/kicad-5.1.5.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T14:16:20.660Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:31:01.418Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/4"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":7,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/107","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/107","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/107/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/107/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#107","relative":"#107","full":"kicad/code/kicad#107"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27934959,"iid":3043,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Symbol editor: old items not unhighlighted after duplicating (lp:#1842750)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1842750) created by **Aleksandr Sh (dsa-t)**\n```\n1.

2 LEDs and then duplicate (no copy/paste) the copper\nzones for the remaining LEDs. After placing the zones I edit each one\nmanually to give them the proper NET.\n\nSometimes, after changing the NET for the copper zone, when pressing the OK\nbutton, a dialog comes up with the following error:\n\n\u003e Warning\n\u003e Orientation must be at least -180 deg.\n\nThis dialog only haves a OK button.\n\nI believe this only has happened on duplicated zones and I haven't found a\npattern to reproduce this issue, but I had it happen on zones with only\nduplication.\n\nI can only make the error go away by deleting the zone\n\n\n\nKICAD:\nApplication: Pcbnew\nVersion: (5.99.0-25-g06802d52d), debug build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.6.5 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.1\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 18.7.0 x86_64), 64 bit, Little endian, wxMac\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,STL containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.54.0\n    Compiler: Clang 9.0.0 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n    KICAD_STDLIB_DEBUG=OFF\n    KICAD_STDLIB_LIGHT_DEBUG=OFF\n    KICAD_SANITIZE=OFF\n\nOS:\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.6\nMacBookPro (Retina Late 2013)\nProcessor: 2.4GHz Intel Core i5\nMemory: 8GB 1600MHz DDR3\nGraphics: Intel Iris 1536MB\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-04T11:56:05.637Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:31:47.734Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T14:31:47.691Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::undecided","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3229","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3229","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3229/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3229/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3229","relative":"#3229","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3229"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27803725,"iid":43,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema crash when pressing V to edit value (lp:#1842652)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1842652) created by **Jonatan Liljedahl (kymatica)**\n```\nTo reproduce:\n\n- launch the app\n- open the schematic\n- hover over a resistor and press V\n- eeschema crashes!\n\nSee attached crash log.\n\nSometimes, if I click on the empty canvas, then press ESC before V, it\nworks.

Build instructions incomplete/improvement (lp:#1842626)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1842626) created by **Michael Weigel (michaelw87)**\n```\nThe documentation on building could be improved:\n\na) Excluding various build targets: The documentation states the flag, e.g.\n\"KICAD_SPICE\" which can be used to exclude (or include) something, but\ndoesn't show, how (e.g. \"To specifically override any of the build targets,\nset the specific flag by adding '-D\u003cYourFlag\u003e=\u003cValue\u003e', e.g.\n\"-DKICAD_SPICE=0\" in the cmake line below\"\n\nb) Default to more than a single-core build:\nThe build instruction says to use \"make\", which defaults to a single-core\nbuild. Shouldn't that be \"make -j \u003cNumberOfCpuCores\u003e\"? Or at least a\nrecommendation that it can be used or why it shouldn't (if there is a\nreason, not to)\n\nc) USE_CCACHE: I know this from using android, which is why I explicitely\nsearched for it, and it indeed exists. A description of it and a default\nusage (not by setting the flag, but by defaulting the build instructions to\nusing it) would be nice, imo\n\nd) Exact packages: Most homepages for the additionally required packages\nallow downloading windows binaries and source code for linux.

Junction should be a property of\ntwo or more wires crossing (or endpoints touching, or endpoint touching\nanother line) and there shouldn't exist any junction without two wire\nlines.\n\nFrom the standpoint of implementation it may be easier to have separate\njunctions but they should very strictly depend on existence of a wire\ncrossing. For example, instead of\n\njunction: xcoord,ycoord\n\nthere could be\n\njunction:\n   wire: id\n   wire: id\n\nBut at least, if they are separate independent entities, they should be\nupdated very stricly with any change made to wires. The update mechanism\nshould be \"waterproof\". I've seen different situations when junction don't\ncorrectly reflect changes made to the wires.\n\nIt shouldn't be possible to add junctions where there are no wires\ncrossing, and there should never be need to remove junctions except from\nwhere wires are crossing. \"Add junction\" shouldn't blindly add a junction\ndot, it should only make a junction out of two wires crossing each other.\n```\nOriginal tags:

But it turns out the longest trace i can do is\n2147mm, 2148mm and more can't be done.\n\nCan you please increase this?\n\nAccording to IRC it's probably caused by internal representation of length\nin micrometers as signed 32 bit number...

created by **Rene Poeschl (poeschlr)**\n```\nI just discovered a possibly useful feature in the eagle file format. They\ninclude a section called compatibility which contains warnings to be\nprinted if opened in an older version.\n\nMight be something interesting to add to kicad to prepare for a time when\nthe file format becomes much more stable than it is now (If only minor\nadditions are made then these can possibly ignored by the user. But the\nuser would need to know what they loose by opening in an older version.\nThis is one way of telling an older version which warning messages to print\nwithout the older version even being aware of the features it does not\nsupport.)\n\nIt could theoretically also include information for the parser on how to\nreplace some unknown things such that they can parse the file kind of\nsafely.\n\nFor example it could contain information which file format tags can be\nignored without changing the outputed file. The differential net clearance\nsetting added with v5 would be such an example. Ignoring it does not change\nthe viewed file it only removes a routing feature.\n\nChamfered pads are a different beast. They would only be able to be\nreplaced by another similar pad type and therefore change the file -\u003e\nshould be an error. But instead of a parser error it would then say \"you\nuse a kicad version that does not understand chamfered pads introduced in\nversion 6.0.0.\" which is much easier to understand by the user. (in reality\na warning could then only be produced by 7.x features as 5.x and earlier\ndoes not understand this feature. But i have no example for such a future\nrelease.)\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-02T08:33:38.945Z","updated_at":"2019-12-28T17:41:37.351Z","closed_at":"2019-12-28T17:41:37.309Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::opinion"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3428","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3428","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3428/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3428/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3428","relative":"#3428","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3428"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27940663,"iid":3380,"project_id":15502567,"title":"wishlist: eeschema: don't un-annotate on cut-and-paste (lp:#1842275)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1842275) created by **Dino Ghilardi (dino-ghilardi)**\n```\nIn the current master version, when you cut and paste a part of a\nschematic, it is un-annotated.

It is especially useful if assembling multiple prototypes.\n\nFor example, if I have five identical 10K resistors in the schematic I will\nhighlight them with the same color in the board printout and in the BOM, so\nI can populate them all at the same time.  The problem is - it takes time\nand eventually you run out of colors.  It would be a neat feature if you\ncould automatically print a board layout with identical components printed\nin bold and the rest of the board greyed out all on separate sheets.\n\nFor example, when I print a board layout for the assembly purposes I print\nonly silkscreen, paste, Fob and mask layers for each side of the board.\nLet's say you have a check box in the print dialog to collate sheets based\non the components.  When checked, instead of one page print you will get as\nmany pages as there are unique components on the board, with each page\ncontaining all the layers I selected to be printed and only the current set\nof components printed in bold and the rest of the board greyed out (still\nvisible but barely)\n```\nOriginal tags: feature.request pcbnew printing","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-29T14:23:18.591Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T18:42:22.621Z","closed_at":"2022-03-03T18:42:22.614Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["feature-request","pcbnew","printing","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2488","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2488","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2488/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2488/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2488","relative":"#2488","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2488"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27928418,"iid":2679,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema crash - segfault on block select (lp:#1841919)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1841919) created by **Dino Ghilardi (dino-ghilardi)**\n```\nOn eeschema, master branch, I get a weird crash: selecting some particular\nblocks crashes kicad.\n\nAttached a kicad project with a box marked \"SELECT THIS BOX\".

SHIFT+click act the same way on sheet pin\nselection.\n\nWish 1:\nEnable the block selection on hierarchical sheet pins.\n\nWish 2:\nHave shift and ctrl work as in \"list\" selection: clicking on a pin item and\nshift-clicking on another would select all the pins between them on the\nborder of the hierarchical child sheet.  The default behaviour could be\n\"clockwise\", so changing the order of the selected two mostly inverts the\nselection.\n\nAny of the two wishes solves the problem.\n\nP.S.: ctrl-clicking on an item behaviour is good as it is now.\n\nPossible problems: without a selection filter to choose if you want to\nselect or not hierarchical sheet pins, block selection could lead to\n\"strange\" behaviours, for instance when you want to \"block select\" a part\nof the schematics and get a multiple selection of components, wires and\nsome hierarchical sheet pins.\n\nCheers,\nDino.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nApplication: Eeschema\nVersion: (5.99.0-9-g85eed87b2), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.52.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2s zlib/1.2.8 libidn2/0.16 libpsl/0.17.0\n(+libidn2/0.16) libssh2/1.7.0 nghttp2/1.18.1 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.9.0-8-amd64 x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.52.1\n    Compiler: GCC 6.3.0 with C++ ABI 1010\n\nBuild settings:\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema modern ui","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-27T08:52:14.694Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T13:19:26.952Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T13:19:26.911Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::low","status::fix-committed","ui"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3034","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3034","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3034/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3034/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3034","relative":"#3034","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3034"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27934792,"iid":3033,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Junction dot is moved when wire end dragged (lp:#1841458)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1841458) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nUnder some circumstances a junction dot is moved even if it shouldn't be\nwhen a wire end is dragged onto another wire.
