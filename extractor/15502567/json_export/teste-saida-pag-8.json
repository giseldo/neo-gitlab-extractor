Instead of opening the child schematic it just selects\nthe box.\n\nIf this behaviour is intended... Double clicking was a very quick way to\nnavigate complex tree-organized schematics, so...

Otherwise accidentally selecting those\nfootprints will make using them impractical.\n\nApplication: Pcbnew\nVersion: (5.1.0-1008-g945eaceb9), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-16T10:06:14.118Z","updated_at":"2020-09-12T20:40:07.471Z","closed_at":"2020-09-12T17:16:23.465Z","closed_by":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2448","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2448","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2448/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2448/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2448","relative":"#2448","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2448"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27802525,"iid":33,"project_id":15502567,"title":"pcbnew crashes when you try to draw a line more than a few segments (lp:#1832930)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1832930) created by **Tim Trzepacz (softegg)**\n```\nPcbnew will frequently crash when I try to use the line tool to draw a\nline, especially if that is the first thing I do.\nOften it happens within the first few segments I draw, especially if I am\nusing Eco2.User, Edge.Cuts, or F.Cu layers.\nUsually it happens immediately, especially if I draw in Eco2.User first\nthing, even if I am editing an empty file.

Clarify DXF Options tooltips (lp:#1832595)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1832595) created by **Olivier (oc-spam66)**\n```\nHello,\n\nWhen I output a DXF file from the \"Edge.Cuts\" layer, the lines produced are\nthe inner and outer edges of the KiCad line (taking into account the\nlinewidth). For an edge of the board, two lines are produced in the DXF\ninstead of one... and none of them is the real edge of the board! Indeed\nmanufacturers usually consider that the edge of the board is the center\nline (linewidth is not a relevant parameter).\n\nRequest: The DXF output of \"Edge.Cuts\" should be made with single lines,\nindicating the real edge of the board (i.e. the center line).\n\nExample of use case: One may want to import the DXF produced by KiCad in a\nmechanical CAD software, in order to represent the board edge. In the\ncurrent situation, it is painful to remove the duplicate lines and correct\nfor all the shifted positions.\n\nIf it is necessary for someone to have the thickness of the line taken into\naccount in the DXF, a checkbox could give the user the choice of the type\nof line to be drawn in the DXF (either one center line, or two external\nlines).\n\nOlivier (KiCad 5.1.2)\n```\nOriginal tags: dxf pcbnew starter","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-12T14:22:36.651Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T13:05:14.992Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T13:05:14.931Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["dxf","pcbnew","priority::low","starter","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":4166641,"username":"imcinerney","name":"Ian McInerney","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4166641/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/imcinerney"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4166641,"username":"imcinerney","name":"Ian McInerney","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4166641/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/imcinerney"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2983","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2983","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2983/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2983/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2983","relative":"#2983","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2983"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27918543,"iid":1803,"project_id":15502567,"title":"pcbnew -

If I then move my mouse to\nsome other place on the schematic, my selected components move with my\ncursor as expected, but then when I hit delete or right-click -\u003e delete\nblock, not only does it delete my block-selected components (which is\nexpected), but it also deletes all the symbols and wires between where I\ndragged my selected block. It seems like after a block selection, the\nselection rectangle is still being updated (even though it isn't being\ndrawn), and when you hit delete, not only is your selection deleted, but\neverything in the invisible selection region is being deleted too.\n\nTo reproduce: place one symbol in eeschema in the lower right, and one in\nthe middle of your screen. Block select the lower right component. Move\ncursor to upper left. Press delete. Observe that component in middle has\nalso been deleted.\n\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.2, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.65.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1c zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.2.0 libpsl/0.20.2\n(+libidn2/2.1.1) libssh2/1.8.2 nghttp2/1.36.0\nPlatform: Linux 5.1.2-arch1-1-ARCH x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 3.24\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Technology: 7.3.0\n    Curl: 7.64.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.3.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=OFF\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.2, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.65.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1c zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.2.0 libpsl/0.20.2\n(+libidn2/2.1.1) libssh2/1.8.2 nghttp2/1.36.0\nPlatform: Linux 5.1.2-arch1-1-ARCH x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 3.24\n    Boost: 1.69.0\n    OpenCASCADE Technology: 7.3.0\n    Curl: 7.64.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.3.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=OFF\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=ON\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-11T02:42:52.604Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:19:03.898Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T19:21:27.277Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085265,"iid":3,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.3","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.3/+download/kicad-5.1.3.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.3/+download/kicad-5.1.3.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T14:12:22.308Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:30:15.472Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/3"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/193","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/193","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/193/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/193/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#193","relative":"#193","full":"kicad/code/kicad#193"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27814479,"iid":364,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Eeschema - Repeat last item doesn't break wires/insert junctions (lp:#1832253)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1832253) created by **Seth Hillbrand (sethh)**\n```\nWhen using the repeat hotkey to insert a new wire, the wire is not broken\nif it overlaps a pin.

behaviour:\n-Open page layout editor\n-File-\u003eNew to have an empty sheet (not needed)\n-Add a new element (tested with line, text and box) to the sheet\n-Select it and copy (ctrl-c or right-click menu)\n-you get a window with:\n   pl_editor information\n   Expecting \"'number'\" in input/source \"Sexpr_string\" line 1, offset 24\n\nIf you try to copy-paste the elements of the default sheet, some work and\nsame give the same error (with different offset)\n\nAttached a file with just a line that issues the error with copy-paste.\n\nLooking at the file, it seems that the end x coordinate has 14 decimal\ndigits instead of the six used for start x,y and end y. may be it is\nrelated to this.\n\n\nTested on

cutout on “edge.cuts” not handled correctly (lp:#1832096)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1832096) created by **Olivier (oc-spam66)**\n```\nHello,\n\nI drew the contour of a board on “edge.cuts” with three cutouts inside: one\nsquare, one circle, and one circle made of two circle arcs. The result is\ncorrectly rendered in the 3D viewer.\n\nHowever it seems that KiCad removes the circle from the generated Gerber,\nas observed in GerbView. It is replaced by a tiny “D10” code, for which the\ndrill map doesn’t seem to have an information. This is incorrect.\n\nIn comparison, the circle made with two arcs is handled correctly (this is\na workaround to obtain a valid circle). So I think there is a bug in the\nhandling of circular cutouts:\n\n- I expect the circle to be handled correctly by KiCad\n- I expect that it is not changed to a drill (I want it to be milled, not\ndrilled).\n\nReference topic on the forum: https://forum.kicad.info/t/circular-cutout-\non-edge-cuts-not-handled-correctly/17474\n\nBest regards,\n\nOlivier\n\n---\nApplication: kicad\nVersion:

intended or not, I report this as a (small)\nbug.\n\nThis comes from the fact that the string put over the child sheet box in\nthe schematic is generated differently in different points of the program:\n\nfor the on screen string:\nsch_painter.cpp line 1299 :        auto text = wxT( \"Sheet: \" ) +\naSheet-\u003eGetName();\n\nFor something else (i did not find where this is used, but I'm

infix (shortcut trigger action) option (lp:#1832011)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1832011) created by **Julien Faucher (suzizecat)**\n```\nHi all,\n\nIn latest nigthlies, due to eeschema tool framework rework, most of\nshortcuts require a mouse click before or after hitting the shortcut key in\norder to be triggered.\n\nIn example, to move a component, you have to select it and then hit \"M\".\nAnother, to draw a wire, hit \"W\" and then the first click will start the\nwire.\n\nIt wasn't the case on pre-5.1 versions (at least) and, in my opinion,\nworking with KiCAD was way faster due to this feature.\n\nHowever, since this seems to be a battle topic between users/dev I would\nsuggest the following :\nAdd an \"Use Infix mode\" option (infix comes from Cadence Virtuoso, I don't\nreally care about the actual name)\n\nThis would make all tools triggered upon shortcut use, at the mouse pointer\nposition. Just how it was done in former KiCAD versions. A key modifier (or\neven better, a new set of shortcut) could be used to have a reverted-infix\n(use infix in normal mode, use tool trigger in infix mode) shortcut.\n\nI really wish to emphasize on the point that not having this behavior\naffect deeply the user experience (IMHO in a pretty bad way, but some won't\nagree with me on that).\n\nFinally, this might be extended to PCBNew, in order to have a unified\nexperience.\n\nBest regards,\nJulien FAUCHER\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-07T14:37:06.929Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:47:25.606Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T14:47:25.259Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3285","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3285","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3285/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3285/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3285","relative":"#3285","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3285"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27941593,"iid":3417,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Keepout area hatched color not clear express the configuration (lp:#1831999)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1831999) created by **Hildo Guillardi Júnior (hildogjr)**\n```\nUsing Keepout area, the hatched have the followed behavior by choose layer:\n- F.Cu -\u003e hatched as red in  one diagonal direction\n- B.Cu -\u003e hatched as green in the other diagonal direction\n- Both - hatched just as the green\n\nShould be interesting this area express, in the colors and hatched\ndirections all affected layers because usually I have to open the\nconfiguration of the ares one-by-one before send the board to production.\n\nOne way to do that is intercalate the lines of hatched by the colors of the\nselected layers.

Previously I had\nLANG=en_GB (originally needed due to limitations in the window manager I\nuse).  Changing it to en_GB.UTF-8 fixed the\nproblem.\n\nSee also test.sch attached. With LANG=en_GB set component R8 (with TBS\ncharacters) cannot be copy\u0026pasted but R9 (without TBS characters can be\ncopy\u0026pasted).  With en_GB.UTF-8 set both components can be copied\u0026pasted.\n\nI know there have been other problems with copy\u0026pasting in the past. Could\nI make a feature-request for a diagnostic printed message/GUI pop-up to be\nproduced when the copy to the clipboard or the paste from it fails, rather\nthan just silently failing which is\nfrustrating and not helpful for problem diagnosis?\n\nThanks\nTom Crane\n\nPs. this problem was first reported in kicad-\ndevelopers@lists.launchpad.net.\n\nKicad detail:\nApplication:

Noticing the problem I have\nswitched the computer off and on to force KiCad to reread directories. I\nhave done it twice but with no effect.\nI just supposed that KiCad reads the footprint lists from directories each\ntime I run Footprint editor.\n\nBut now during writeing here I should say something - at second computer I\nhave also the same KiCad version installed but not with my libarary list,\nbut with ortiginal lists. When I run Footprint editor at that computer it\nbehaves diferently from day to day. Sometimes it looks that it hangs during\nimporting footprints at the beginning, but after more than one minute it\nfinishes and looks OK. Sometimes it takes about 30 seconds to run Footprint\nEditor and sometims it looks like it needs no time - just run, and in one\nor two seconds it is ready.\n\nNow come back to my working computer (it is not connected to internet so\nWindows 7 is not updated since 2 years, but I would not suppose it would be\na source of problem).\n\nToday I decided to move all my PLxxyy.kicad_mod from my S library to my H\nlibrary.\nI started doing it with KiCad using 'Save as' and 'Delete' - this way I\nmoved PL0512, PL0513, PL0613. Then decided to move rest faster using file\nmanagement program (FreeCommander). I have done it (probably not closing\nFootprint Editor, but not sure). And now the situation is as you can see in\nattached screenshots.\nWhen I try to enter (double click) the unexisting footprint - just nothing\nhappenes.\nI have reopened Footprint Editor, and whole KiCad several times, I have\nswithced off and on computer - no effect.\nI tried to find \"PL0815\" text in my KiCad installation directory and in my\nAppData/Roaming/kicad directory to discover where from KiCad can get this\nold directory situation.

(oc-spam66)**\n```\nHello,\n\nConsider this situation of importing a DXF file in KiCad:\n- I would like that the lines are created with a linewidth of 0.15 mm (for\nexample).\n- If the DXF file is in micrometers, it can be imported by setting the\nscale factor to 0.001 in the import dialog. However, it is now necessary to\nchange the linewidth to 150 mm in the dialog, so that it is really 0.15 mm\nafter the import.\n\nThis workaround should not be necessary and is a bit ridiculous. When the\nuser asks for a precise linewidth, he should obtain what he asked for.\n\nRequest: The linewidth should be applied _after_ scaling, not before.\n\nIn the same manner, the placement translation should be applied after the\nscaling.
