User wants to save all changes made.\n2. User wants to cancel and return to Symbol Editor.\n3. User wants to quit and save no changes.\n4. User wants to quit and save only some changes.\n\nThe dialog supports #1 easily because all libraries are checked initially\nand one can click the \"OK\" button.\n\n#2 is also easily handled because of the \"Cancel\" button.\n\nSo IMO the first two workflows are straightforward and fine.\n\nThe last item will always take some work of clicking libraries individually\nand doesn't seem any simplification can be made.\n\nHowever, #3 is tricky. It requires de-selecting all libraries individually\nor clicking the \"Unselect All\" button and then the \"OK\" button, two clicks.\nClicking twice isn't excessively draining to the user, but it made me think\nabout the generic text of the \"OK\" button. Let's say the \"OK\" button was\nrenamed to \"Save\" and a third button named \"Don't Save\" was added. Then not\nonly are the button functions salient without reading any other text, but\n#3 above becomes a single click too. That would seem to fit better with\nmodern OSes (Windows and Mac, at least) which have or are getting more\nexplicit button names.\n\nIt's just a little bit of polish. At least, I view it at polish.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.3\n    libcurl/7.54.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2l zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0 nghttp2/1.23.1\nlibrtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.3 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.60.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.54.1\n    Compiler: GCC 7.1.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=OFF\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: libedit ui","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-25T00:37:25.918Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T07:33:34.693Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T07:33:34.660Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::low","status::fix-released","ui"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":15,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1006","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1006","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1006/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1006/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1006","relative":"#1006","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1006"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27879236,"iid":1208,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Assert on zone selection (lp:#1783442)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1783442) created by **Evan Shultz (evan-shultz)**\n```\nI had been running 5.0.0 RC3 until today when I installed 5.0.0 from the\nmirror on the website.

difficulty in trying to route a controlled impedance\ndifferential pair. I am trying to make a pair with 14thou wide traces with\n20thou spacing, but unfortunately every time I chose to select the custom\nvalue and start to route a differential pair, it defaults straight to a\npair of 0.2mm wide traces and a spacing of 0.25mm.\n\nI cannot find out how to route the differential pair that I require for my\ndesign as it is being reset every time I try to do so.\n\nI was earlier having a different issue regarding differential pairs, so I\ndecided to try out a the latest nightly build, however I am now faced with\nthis issue.

properties of a symbol, you can not assign an\nempty value to a field.\nParadoxically, I find myself unable to remove the component code that is\nnot found at a distributor.\n\nI think it is more than normal that the component is not available in all\ndistributors of components: In my case I enter the codes of the various\ndistributors so that the assembler can then choose the one that suits him\nbest.\n\nCONFIG I use it to manage different versions of assembly and is normally\nempty except when the component is not to be assembled or to be mounted in\nparticular versions.\n\nThe same applies to Voltage Tolerance etc since for example VOLTAGE for a\nresistor does not make sense so the field is normally empty ....\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 6.0.0-rc1-unknown-r13337-2c833f2c,

Who made the \"Aesthetics\" library?\nWho made \"Batteries\" vs \"Battery\"? I don't know (from looking at this)\neither. When I choose footprints, however, I'd like to always give\npreference to first: the KiCad core libraries, 2nd: other well-maintained\nlibraries, 3rd: my own custom libraries (which I try to minimize).\n\nSomehow I think there needs to be a way to indicate this. Perhaps adding\nthe library path to the very bottom of the screen in the small font next to\nthe other data there?\n\nMeanwhile, a work-around is to just rename all footprint folders so that\nyou specify a common word at the beginning of the folder name. Ex:\n\"SparkFun-Batteries\", \"SparkFun-Aesthetics\", etc. However, that is a pain\nas it requires me renaming other people's folders, then submitting a pull\nrequest to them which they might not even accept.\n```\nOriginal tags:

path variable apparently hard coded (lp:#1782708)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1782708) created by **Oivind Toien (otoien)**\n```\nIn the latest Windows nightly, Version: (6.0.0-rc1-dev-93-g3c1dc9e5c),\nrelease build  the  KISYS3DMOD path variable appears as if it is now hard\ncoded. The following was tested in a VM where there are no system\nenvironmental variables set in Windows.  After 6.0 development version\ninstall, this variable is reset to the program folder. I have the KiCad\nofficial library files organized under my home folder, thus I would need\nthe change this variable under Configure Paths of the main window. However\nafter editing the path value the attached message appears, indicating that\nthe variables have been set externally and will be overwritten next time\nKiCad is started (again, the system environment variables in Windows have\n**not** been set; they are not there when checking after install).\n\nMoreover, in most cases Kicad get stuck on this dialog with high CPU\nactivity, and I need to let Windows terminate KiCad. Even if I press Cancel\nin the Configure path Window I get this dialog, and get stuck. I have in a\ncouple of cases I was able to get past the dialog, and next time KiCad was\nstarted the path was reset to the program folder.\n\nIf it is intentional that this variable is locked to the program folder I\ndisagree, and it will create problems for all custom footprint libraries\nthat had to use the KYSYS3D model variable as root for their 3D model\nlocation. It will also prevent official libraries to be installed anywhere\nbut the program folder, so users will need administrative privileges to\nmake any updates beyond the KiCad install.\n\nThis might be

to use Ultiboard way back before it became part of National\nSemiconductor, and it had a very useful thing that was great for making\ndefined PCB sizes. Once the origin had been selected, the line length could\nbe entered as a relative co-ordinate and it was that simple. Say I was\nlaying out as 1\" square board, I could click the start of the line and\nenter *25.4,0 or something like that and the line would be there.  Repeat\nat next corner etc. A bit like AutoCad or DraftSight. That would be really\nuseful when doing board edges.\n\nI must admit that the move exactly function is helpful, and the ability to\nedit lines as well.\n\nIf it was possible to set the drawing line width for all projects, that\nwould be good as one of my PCB producers likes 0.01mm width profiles (board\noutline). Generally I draw a small line segment then edit it to have a\nwidth of 0.001mm as default and that stays set for the whole board. I do\nsimilar things for the drawings layer.\n\nI would be handy for dimensions as well, since that does not have a default\nset width option. It is preset to .3mm. I usually  edit the precision to\nxx.x mm as most board manufacturers are +/- .1 mm anyway and have to do\nthis for every dimension used, in addition to changing the line width.\n\nIf these could be set in a global template and maybe the Global design\nrules track size options as well it would save some frustration at every\nnew PCB layout I do.\n\nStill a great package though, so thanks to all the developers who make it\npossible.\n```\nOriginal tags:

It also\nautomatically assigns pin/pad numbers to each pin.\n\nBut this pad-number-assignment behavior is not good when the user wants to\ncreate an array of aperture pads. Aperture pads are those without a copper\nlayer assigned. They are useful, for example, when creating custom solder\npaste mask openings on a package which has an exposed thermal pad. Since\nthese pads don't have copper connectivity, they don't, and indeed cannot,\nhave pin numbers (nor can they have nets).\n\nAlso, the pin number of a pad with no copper layer assigned does not appear\nin the pad, so even if a pin number is assigned, it's not visible to the\nuser.\n\nMy recent experience is this. I had a board made with a QFN w/exposed\npackage chip and I ordered a stencil for it. The footprint I used for this\nchip had the solder paste mask checked for the entire exposed pad, so the\nstencil had a big square for the exposed pad, which is not good. I wanted\nto order a new stencil with the recommended 3x3 array of 1.25 mm square\nexposed areas on 1.8 mm pitch, so I edited the footprint in place. I edited\nthe pad and unchecked the F.Paste layer for it. I then created a 1.25 mm\nsquare pad with no copper and only the F.Paste layer enabled. I made sure\nthat the pad number field was blank, as well as the net name field. I\ncreated the pad array, and updated the PCB with this footprint.\n\nThe PCB ratsnest showed that some connections on the chip needed to be\nmade, and DRC complained about unconnected traces/pads. The ratsnest showed\nthat I needed to make connections to the paste-mask-only pads I just added.\n\nAgain, those pads did not show any pin number, so it was somewhat baffling\nwhy pcbnew wanted to me make a connection to a pad with no copper, which\nmeant no way to actually make that connection.\n\nIn pcbnew, I looked at the aperture pads' Properties, and saw that they had\npin numbers assigned, as such:\n\n+--+--+--+\n|33|23|13|\n+--+--+--+\n|32|22|12|\n+--+--+--+\n|31|21|11|\n+--+--+--+\n\nand the net name of each was the same as the real pin of the same number.\nSo that explained why the connectivity check thought the aperture pads\nneeded to be connected. But since the pads have no copper, the connection\nis impossible.\n\nSo, suggestions:\n\na) In the footprint editor, it should never be possible to assign pad\nnumbers and net names to aperture pads. That is, if no copper layer is\nenabled for the pads, the pad number and net name edit boxes should be\ngrayed out/disabled and any text in them should be deleted.\n\nb) The footprint editor array function should never assign pad numbers to\naperture pads.\n\nDoing so will prevent pcbnew from assigning a net name to a pad with no\nconnectivity, and that'll keep the connectivity check happy.\n```\nOriginal tags: array","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-15T03:51:18.003Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T06:56:06.754Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T06:56:06.721Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/859","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":8,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/859","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/859/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/859/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#859","relative":"#859","full":"kicad/code/kicad#859"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27918354,"iid":1780,"project_id":15502567,"title":"EESchema ERC does not flag unconnected hierarchical pins (lp:#1781725)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1781725) created by **Victor W (vicw)**\n```\nWhen running ERC on EEScheme, it is possible for exposed hierarchical sheet\npins to be unconnected on either the top level or child sheets, without\ntriggering a ERC error.\n\nMore specifically, it appears there is no check to confirm that an exposed\nport is electrically connected across a top level sheet and a child sheet.\nThis can result in parts of the design not being connected.\n\n===\nExample 1:\n\n1. On the top level sheet of a hierarchical design, add a child sheet, with\nsome ports.\n\n2. Pick a port that is connected (within the child sheet) to at least two\npins. For example, select an IO port that connected within the child sheet\nto a capacitor and to the input port of an IC.\n\n3. On the top level sheet, delete all connections to that port (the net to\nthe port should be floating).\n\n4. Run eeschema DRC.\n\n===\n\nRESULT:\n\n1. No errors or violations will be noted.\n\n===\n\nExpected:\n\n1. I expect that unconnected sheet ports are flagged; if we've exported\nthem to a sheet, then that sheet should be treated similarly to a symbol;\nunless you deliberately place an NC on that pin, then it's clear the port\nshould be connected somewhere else in the schematic.\n\n2. It is also possible for this to result in missed connections between\nchild and parent sheets; if the top level net on the parent sheet is\notherwise connected (or passes the DRC checks), and the port within the\nchild sheet is unconnected, this also does not flag a DRC check.\n\n===\n\nNote that there already exists a specific error in the event sheet pins are\nnot synchronized (ie; ErrType(6): Mismatch between hierarchical labels and\npins sheets), though there is no error if the hierarchical labels or pin\nsheet are not connected.\n\n===\n\nVersion Information\n\nApplication:
