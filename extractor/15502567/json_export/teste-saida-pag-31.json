While in track drawing\nmode you push delete to delete a track segment and backspace to delete the\nwhole track up to the nearest pad or via (there was a separate bug report\nhere https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1490958)  Unfortunately it is\nstill not working properly.  If the track is within another footprint\nextents or next to another footprint, pressing DEL or Backspace deletes the\ntrack segment or the whole track (which is correct behavior) but at the\nsame time it deletes the footprint as well (which is not suppose to happen)\nIf you hit undo you can reverse deleting the footprint while the track\nremains deleted.  So you can eventually get the the desired result, it just\ntakes several steps.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (2017-04-26 revision ade263f30)-makepkg, release build\nLibraries: wxWidgets 3.0.2\n           libcurl/7.52.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2k zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0\nnghttp2/1.19.0 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\n- Build Info -\nwxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\nBoost: 1.60.0\nCurl: 7.52.1\nKiCad - Compiler: GCC 6.3.0 with C++ ABI 1010\n        Settings: USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n                  USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n                  BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n                  KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: gal pcbnew pns","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-05-03T20:08:04.470Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T16:09:28.740Z","closed_at":"2020-04-18T11:42:15.661Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::medium","rendering","router","status::confirmed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":8,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1767","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":46,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1767","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1767/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1767/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1767","relative":"#1767","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1767"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27940175,"iid":3343,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Eeschema: interrupted lines in some zoomlevels (lp:#1687491)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1687491) created by **Jonas Stein (news-g)**\n```\nreproduce: In kicad 4.0.5 and 4.0.6 draw a circuit and zoom in and out a\nfew times.\nOnly a few zoomlevels have this glitch.

manufacture. I was alarmed to find a missing\nfootprint in the finished board.\n\nI ran the DRC again - it passed...\n\nI think I must have accidently deleted a footprint. Because upon re-\nimporting the netlist, the footprint appeared.\n\nIf the footprint exists in PcbNew, the DRC checks it against the netlist.\nThus, once I re-imported the netlist (no changes to the netlist since the\nbaord was manufactured, just a re-import), the offending footprint tripped\na DRC fail. This is correct.\n\nHowever, if I (accidently) delete a footprint, the DRC passes.\n\nSo it seems the DRC corectly checks footprint pads for connectivity, but\nignores the total number of net nodes, and merrily passes a board which is\ncompletely missing entire footprints - despite the netlist import.\n\nApplication: pcbnew\nVersion: 4.0.4-stable release build\nwxWidgets: Version 3.0.2 (debug,wchar_t,compiler with C++ ABI 1009,GCC\n5.2.0,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 32 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBoost version: 1.59.0\n         USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n         USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n         KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n         USE_FP_LIB_TABLE=HARD_CODED_ON\n         BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: drc","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-04-22T14:56:56.570Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:18:39.939Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T11:25:55.367Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["drc","priority::medium","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":17,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2755","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":28,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2755","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2755/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2755/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2755","relative":"#2755","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2755"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27911479,"iid":1541,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Hierarchical pins prone to shorting nets (lp:#1685508)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1685508) created by **David Pearce (halzia)**\n```\nWishlist item probably.

In the same manner if I have parts which differ in appearance but\nshare the same footprint you can add multiple shapes and then select\nappropriate shape in PCBnew.

I\nbelieve this is the correct place to submit such things, so apologies if I\nhave misunderstood.\n\nI should also say, that is is not something specific, to kicad, but\nsomething that is lacking from all modern CAD systems.\n\nI would like to see the ability to enter \"modes\" such as a move footprint\nmode, delete net mode mode, mode reference designator mode, move by\nreference designator mode etc etc.\n\nIt is, for example, incredible tiresome when shifting stuff on the screen\nand you are constantly having to choose whether you want to delete, say, a\ntrack, a component or a junction when they are all close together. It would\nbe much better to have the editor know that you want to delete tracks then\nyou could go round clicking knowing that you were only going to delete a\ntrack and not worry about whether it was constantly asking you to clarify\nwhether you wanted to delete the junction or the symbol that was also in\nthe click vicinity.\n\nSo, in summary I am suggesting you have a menu and hotkey that would put\nthe editor into delete net mode and whenever you click on the screen, if\nthere is a net there it is immediately deleted. Importantly, do not exit\nthis mode once you have deleted a track until the escape key is pressed.\n\nIn the same way, you would have a mode where you selected move component\nmode. Then, every time you clicked on the screen, it would just pick up\ncomponent under the the cursor, put it down when you next clicked and, very\nimportantly, still be in that same mode until you hit escape.\n\nThere are lots of other modes that would be equally as useful. For example\nthe mode you get when you hit T to move component.

Let's say that you picked the left corner for your position file as\nthe origin.  In PCB new the coordinates are of the same sign for the top\nand the bottom layer because you are in the \"see through\" view.  However\nwhen the board is flipped on the pick and place machine your top left\ncorner now became top right corner and all X coordinates now should be\nnegative.\n\nAnd another suggestion.  For the ascii position file the separate fields\nare delineated with spaces, so during file generation all the spaces in all\nthe fields used need to be replaced with underscore.  Not sure about other\nfields, but I personally use spaces a lot in the value field (i.e.\ndesignate voltage of a capacitor or precision, like 47uF 50V)  If those\nspaces are not replaced the file will be corrupted when imported into a\npick and place machine.\n```\nOriginal tags: fabrication pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-04-03T14:56:30.144Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T23:53:38.658Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T23:53:38.609Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::medium","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1087157,"iid":12,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.0.0-rc2","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.0-rc2/+download/kicad-5.0.0-rc2.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-03T06:48:31.614Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:32:07.740Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/12"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1665","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1665","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1665/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1665/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1665","relative":"#1665","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1665"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27816353,"iid":705,"project_id":15502567,"title":"PCB editor rotates footprint around random center (lp:#1679190)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1679190) created by **Art (diametrix)**\n```\nWell not entirely random but pretty close.  When you need to rotate a\nfootprint you would make your selection and then use keyboard shortcut or\ncontext menu to rotate the whole selection.  However, it seems that the\ncenter of the rotation is defined by your mouse coordinates.  Considering\nlack of capability to snap mouse pointer to grid this makes this\nfunctionality completely unusable.  The only option to rotate a footprint\nis to switch back to the default mode and do it there.  In the default mode\nyou select a rectangular area and the rotate around the center of that\nrectangle, which is not the best solution but at least it is usable.  You\ncan select large grid size and make your rectangular selection symmetrical\naround the origin, thus making sure that your selection is turned around\nthe origin.\n\nUltimately there should be an easy way to rotate selection either around\nthe origin or around the center of a pad.  You can have some logic\nimplemented to see if the mouse pointer is near the origin then the origin\nis used as the center or if it is on a pad, then the center of the pad is\nused.\n\nThe situation with the mirror function is even more confusing.  Mouse\npointer position does affect the position of the final result but it is not\nimmediately apparent as to how.  The same logic of mirroring it around an\naxis or a center of a pad would be preferable.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (2017-04-02 revision 2f9be81b1)-makepkg, release build\nLibraries: wxWidgets 3.0.2\n           libcurl/7.52.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2k zlib/1.2.11 libssh2/1.8.0\nnghttp2/1.19.0 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\n- Build Info -\nwxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\nBoost: 1.60.0\nCurl: 7.52.1\nKiCad - Compiler: GCC 6.3.0 with C++ ABI 1010\n        Settings: USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n                  USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n                  KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=OFF\n                  BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n                  KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: gal pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2017-04-03T14:20:48.852Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T17:13:05.263Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T12:10:50.700Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::undecided","rendering","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":0,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/705","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/705","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/705/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/705/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#705","relative":"#705","full":"kicad/code/kicad#705"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27911474,"iid":1539,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema: layout description file ignored starting in standalone mode (lp:#1678849)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1678849) created by **Sergey A.

For 500V clearance, UL\n60950 would require 1.6mm spacing and that is the value that I should put\ninto the Clearance field of the shape. I may want 1.6mm from this zone to\nother copper, but if the product is in a plastic box with a single-sided\nboard it may be possible to run the zone right to the board edge. Pcbnew,\nhowever, would still back off the board edge by 1.6mm which reduces my\nusable routing area.\n\nSee the attached project for an example. The upper zone is priority 2 and\nhas 0.508mm clearance while the bottom zone is priority 1 and has 1.016mm\nclearance. Both zones are backed off from the board edge by their clearance\nvalue and the bottom zone, having a lower priority, backs off 1.016mm from\nthe upper zone. And also note that the net class for both zones' nets have\n0.7mm spacing.\n\nThere are certainly hacks to get around this, but they're hacks. Since\nboard edge and copper-copper are, to me, distinct spacing requirements I\nthink they should be controlled separately.\n\nI could be misusing Pcbnew or misunderstanding. If this can already be\nhandled, please forgive me and point me in the right direction.

But the silkscreen is removed only from the soldermask openings,\nwhile a bigger margin may be required. This additional margin could be\nconfigured in the same dialog or, preferably, it could be defined per-pad\nbasis, just as we can configure a custom soldermask opening per pad. So my\nrecommendation is to add a \"silk to soldermask clearance\" property for\npads.\n\nCurrently, the not so convenient \"volatile\" workaround is:\n- generate all gerbers,\n- save the design, preferably not forgetting to make a backup,\n- redefine soldermask openings of all pads in question (not forgetting\nabout any of them),\n- generate silkscreen gerbers with silk-soldermask subtraction,\n- do not save the design in the above two steps!\n- recover the saved design.\n```\nOriginal tags:

I found that the shortcuts behaved erratically, though,\nsometimes they worked and sometimes they would not. Now I realize that this\ndepended on whether I had moved the mouse after selecting the track.\nLooking back, I think my assumption came from the fact that other tools do\nwork on the selected element.\n\nI would suggest extending these shortcuts so they also work with the\ncurrently selected track. Now that I know about the hovering behavior, that\nis easy to work with, but I think that working from the selected track\nmight also be useful (not in the least to prevent confusion with a new user\nas I have found). I think there's two alternatives here:\n\n 1. Whenever a track is selected, use it, even when the mouse hovers over\nanother track.\n 2.
