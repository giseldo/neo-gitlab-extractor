Need a single keyboard shortcut for that.\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-23T17:30:57.584Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T22:32:51.415Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T22:32:51.381Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::fix-released"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/415","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":14,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/415","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/415/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/415/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#415","relative":"#415","full":"kicad/code/kicad#415"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27876393,"iid":946,"project_id":15502567,"title":"\"Single pad nets delete\" option of Read netlist is unnecessary (lp:#1615755)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1615755) created by **Novak Tamas (novak-7)**\n```\nI can't see the reason for \"Single pad nets delete\" option of Read netlist.\n\nEeschema always includes single pad nets (unconnected pins, even if they\nare flagged not-connected in schematic) in netlist.\nIf this netlist is read into pcbnew, these single-pin nets will be loaded.\nWhen Reading netlist next time, nothing happens if Single pad nets option\nis set to Keep.\nOn the other hand, if this option is set to Delete, every run of Read\nnetlist\ngenerates pairs of\n\nChanging component \"D2:/54AFB4C9\" pin \"3\" net name from \"\" to\n\"Net-(D2-Pad3)\".\nRemove single pad net \"Net-(D2-Pad3)\" on \"D2\" pad '3'\n\nmessages for each of unconnected pins.\n\nIf you don't want to be flood by messages and filter out Infos and\nWarnings, these messages keep displaying as they are type of Action.\nActions and Errors disabled is really bad idea.\n\nMy wish is opting out \"Single pad nets delete\" option from Read netlist (it\nshould always work like set to \"Keep\").

non-solder side,\nand also with translation from other CAD tools.\n\nThen, the first (mounted side) Stack thermally connects OK, however second\nstack tries, but comes up short.\n\nIf I ask for Solid (no thermal), it also gets confused on the more complex\nPad Stack, \u0026 gives a round cutout for a rounded rect pad on non-mounted\nside ?!.\n\nAlso, that variable Stack gives a false/unwanted DRC report, like\n\nErrType(25): Hole near pad\n    @ (179.070 mm,104.140 mm): Pad 1 on F.Cu, Non-copper of J2\n    @ (179.070 mm,104.140 mm): Pad 1 on B.Cu, Non-copper of J2\n\nTo me it is preferable to have _one_ stack define the Drill/Slot+Top, as\nthat is easier to edit later.\n\nThat means the DRC should tolerate a hole/Slot thought a SMD pad of the\nSAME Part.PinNum\n\n\nTested

Now you have to\ngo through some FootPrint's 3D settings to Configure Paths and set aliases.\nGood idea! When you set only 1 alias, you don't even have to modify 3D\nmodel's name.\nBut when you want more...\n\n1.\nIf you set more than 1 alias, you have to specify alias in 3D model's name.\nLike global:library.3dshapes/model.wrl or local:model.wrl otherwise you\ncan't see model.\nThis could be improved by searching all paths if alias is not specified in\nmodel name. You can already modify order of records, like it was intended\nto work this way, to order them by priority.\nIf this will be done, final path should be displayed somewhere.\n\n2.\nKicad shows warning every time it looks for 3D models and some path does\nnot exist.\nIt sounds ok until you set project specific path like ${KIPRJMOD}/3D, you\nget this warning in each project that does not have such sub-directory.\nThis could be solved by project only 3D aliases and/or by silently ignoring\ninvalid paths and just hilighting them in window where you administrate\nthem.\n\nQ.\nIs this 3D path alias administration accessible simply from some menu or\njust from footprint's 3D model config window?\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n```\nOriginal tags: 3d pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-05-24T19:26:23.454Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T20:27:52.429Z","closed_at":"2019-12-29T11:43:07.175Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["3d-viewer","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2026","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2026","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2026/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2026/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3394"},"references":{"short":"#2026","relative":"#2026","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2026"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27878307,"iid":1110,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Open project folder in host OS (lp:#1584977)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1584977) created by **Mithat Konar (mkonar-dogus+ubuntu)**\n```\nMany IDEs and other project-based tools let you open the project's root\nfolder (directory) in the host OS's file manager.

In the latest nightly (2016-04-23 BZR 6710, Git\nc1f0ab9) this is known as \"Default Fields\", which I think is a better name.\n\nThe current description is:\n\n     \"You can define custom fields that will exist by default in each\ncomponent (even if left empty).\"\n\nThis is an inadequate description of a very useful function, and it is\nincorrect in that these fields do not exist in the schematic components or\ntheir representation in schematic libraries.  They are presented as fields\nin the edit dialogues but they are only written to the component in the\nschematic or library if \"OK\" is chosen to close the edit dialogue.\n\nI explored the behavior of this system with 4.0.2-stable at:\nhttp://www.firstpr.com.au/kicad/#tfn .  I assume the behavior is the same\nin the latest nightly.  The latest nightly has a new and improved user\ninterface which avoids confusion due to text boxes and an \"Add\" button,\nwhich I think is the cause of a bug report\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1389272 which I think could now be\nmarked as resolved.\n\nI suspect that the new user interface does not require any explanation.\nHere is some suggested text to replace the current single sentence.\nIdeally someone would check the validity of this and revise it to fit the\nstyle of the manual.\n\n- - -\n\nDefault Fields are a mechanism for easily introducing additional fields\ninto components in schematics or component definitions in schematic\nlibraries.\n\nEach Default Field consists of a field name, a default value for this field\n- which can be empty - and a flag which controls whether the value of this\nfield will be visible in the schematic editing screen and the printed\nschematic.\n\nThese configuration items are part of the Eeschema configuration and are\nnot part of any schematic sheet or project.\n\nThe one or more Default Fields specified here do not exist in any\ncomponents in schematics or in  schematic libraries until each such\ncomponent is edited and the \"OK\" button is pressed in the edit dialogue\nbox.  Then, the one or more Default Fields are added to the already\nexisting fields for this component, starting at field 4, with any\npreviously existing fields 4 and above being renumbered accordingly.\nChanges can be made to the value and/or visibility flag during this initial\nedit session or at any subsequent time.\n\nLater changes to the default value of a Default Field will not affect the\nvalue of fields which have already been added to components.  Once one or\nmore fields have been added to a component, each also has parameters for\nposition, size and orientation of the text, when displayed in the\nschematic.\n\n- - -\n\nThe ability to add one or more new fields into components, per component or\nat the library level, is powerful and important.  It is the basis for\nseveral attempts at creating greatly improved BOMs and the like, such as\nthose described at: https://rheingoldheavy.com/category/education/kicad/  .\n\nI think the explanation could be enhanced at the start or end by some\nmention of the use of these fields in creating sophisticated schematic-\nbased data systems as the basis for generating BOMs.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-04-26T10:28:14.980Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T00:34:58.000Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T00:34:57.694Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::duplicate"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1737","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1737","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1737/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1737/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1737","relative":"#1737","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1737"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27921955,"iid":2016,"project_id":15502567,"title":"proportionally shrinking conflicting zones (lp:#1571926)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1571926) created by **Simon Richter (sjr)**\n```\nWhen two zones intersect, the zone with lower priority is shrunk to avoid a\nconflict.\n\nIt would be great to have a way to have both zones shrink proportionally,\nso e.g. if 1:1 is specified, the boundary for the higher-priority zone will\ngo exactly down the middle of the clearance.\n\n2:1 means that the zone specifying 2 will shrink 2/3 of the clearance.\n\n0:1 means that the zone specifying 0 will not yield, even if it is lower-\npriority.\n\n0:0 means traditional behaviour -- higher-priority zone wins.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-04-19T03:09:56.069Z","updated_at":"2020-12-20T19:02:27.494Z","closed_at":"2020-12-20T19:02:27.456Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::new"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2016","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2016","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2016/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2016/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2016","relative":"#2016","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2016"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27935373,"iid":3078,"project_id":15502567,"title":"RFE: Cleanup tracks and vias dry-run option (lp:#1571305)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1571305) created by **Berk Akinci (berka)**\n```\nRequest for enhancement.\n\nCleanup tracks and vias function would be much more appealing if it\nselected objects as opposed to just going ahead and deleting them.

vs. Soldermask clearance collisions at corners (lp:#1563744)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1563744) created by **Paul \"LeoNerd\" Evans (leonerd)**\n```\nIf you place an SMT pad in a zone, due to the way the zone clearance gets\nrounded corners it can mean there's a little bit of copper that overlaps\ninto the pad area.\n\nFor example: the attached screenshot shows a zone of clearance 0.01in\ninside which is placed an SMT pad of mask clearance just under 0.008in (the\nactual value 0.007874015748in being 0.2mm). You would expect that this is\nperfectly safe; a nice 0.002in of safety margin between the solder mask\nopening and the copper zone.\n\nBut you'd be wrong. The problem is that the zone clearance only applies\nvertically and horizontally from the pad; the cleared area within the zone\ngets a rounded corner of radius 0.010in, meaning it could only guarantee\nclearance of a square corner at most 0.00707...in (0.01in * sqrt(2)) wide.\nThe mask clearance of 0.008in gives a tiny margin of bare copper from the\nfilled zone exposed within the pad clearance area.\n\nThis isn't just a rendering issue; I have had a bad copper run of boards\nfrom the fab because of actual spilled out copper in these pad areas,\ncausing grounding shorts to the pads when soldered.\n\nAs a workaround for these collisions I've been manually editing the per-pad\nCu clearance settings and increasing it on any pad that would be affected.\nI'd prefer to leave the global zone clearance at a nice small 0.01in though\nbecause I need to route some grounding pour between TTH connector pads, so\nthat can't be too big.\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-03-30T09:06:41.618Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T15:59:23.293Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T11:24:24.283Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::medium","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":31,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2753","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":62,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2753","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2753/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2753/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2753","relative":"#2753","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2753"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27876371,"iid":944,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema: \"Import Schematic Sheet Content\" import Page Settings (lp:#1563477)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1563477) created by **Eldar Khayrullin (eldar)**\n```\nI don't know it is a bug or not.\nI expect to see that page settings should be mine but not from import\nschematic.\nNow after import mine page setting overrides with imported.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 0.201603270401+6651~43~ubuntu15.10.1-product, release build\nLibraries: wxWidgets 3.0.2\n           libcurl/7.43.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2d zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.28 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.2.0-34-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\n- Build Info -\nwxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\nBoost: 1.58.0\nCurl: 7.43.0\nKiCad -

Here, “archive” is not a kind of\na compressed container. It is merely a directory structure with files\nin it. To simplify matters, the directory is named ${KICAD}. The\nproject lives in the directory ${BOARD} with a sub-directory\n${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty “pointing” into the\narchive. That way I keep track which footprints are REQUIRED by the\nproject and —the other way around— I can keep track of the utilization\nof a particular component. “Pointing” is done by file system\nlinks. This all works fine. But if I update a footprint the link is\ndestroyed by the footprint editor.\n\nIn detail:\n\n 1  Initially there is no link between archive and project:\n\n    h@b4:${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty$ ls -l\nSMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n    ls: cannot access SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod: No such file or directory\n\n 2a “SMA_EDGE_MNT” is required, create a link:\n\n    h@b4:${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty$ ln -s\n${KICAD}/mod/connect_local.pretty/SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod .\n    h@b4:${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty$ ls -l\nSMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n    lrwxrwxrwx 1 h me 65 Feb 23 12:52 SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod -\u003e\n${KICAD}/mod/connect_local.pretty/SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n\n 3a The footprint is accessible from the project now. But after\n    updating the footprint we have:\n\n    h@b4:${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty$ ls -l\nSMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 h me 2694 Feb 23 12:52 SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n\n    The link is replaced by an ordinary file. The changes are lost and\n    will never be recorded in the archive.\n\n 2b Instead of creating a symlink (which must be explicitly evaluated\n    within the program) I use a hardlink to refer to the archive:\n\n    h@b4:${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty$ ln\n${KICAD}/mod/connect_local.pretty/SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod .\n    h@b4:${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty$ ls -l\nSMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n    -rw-r--r-- 2 h me 2694 Feb 23 12:52 SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n\n 3b Again, the footprint can be read from the project. But after the\n    first write we have:\n\n    h@b4:${BOARD}/kicad/mod/connect_local.pretty$ ls -l\nSMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 h me 2690 Feb 23 12:55 SMA_EDGE_MNT.kicad_mod\n\n    And gain, the link is broken (link count reset to 1).\n\nThis is nasty, because updates are lost “magically” and it took me\nsome time to find out where the various revisions of my footprint came\nfrom. There is a workaround, though. Use the “Export footprint” button\nand write directly into the archive. That way the relations between\ncomponents and projects are lost.\n```\nOriginal tags: dataloss filesystem

In the middle is a male thru hole header whose\npurpose is test point access for each of the nets.\n\nThe test point pads seem to bisect the nets into two lengths, pre- and\npost- test pad runs.  All the nets are on the top layer, both post- and\npre- test pad portions.  If one temporarily changes all the test pads to\nreside only on the back Cu layer, then clicking on any part of the net then\nshows the full length of the net, extending from SMD connector to chip.\nThe test pads are temporarily set aside.   Or so one would think.\n\nWhen I go to length match these nets, the length detection logic seems to\nbring the test pads back in and reverts to the bisection.  So I am unable\nto length match the nets, which at this moment, because of the temporary\nchange to my test pads,  technically consist of the full run from SMD to\nchip.  The length matching test seems to use different code than the \"click\non any segment of the net and update the status bar code\".\n\nAlso, bug #2, during length matching drag, the changing length shown\nnumerically not updating with sufficient granularity, neither for a) mouse\nmovements, and b) nor for numeric meandering wave shaping using the number\nkeys.  b) is especially noticeable.\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-02T19:01:29.654Z","updated_at":"2021-04-05T00:27:26.978Z","closed_at":"2021-04-05T00:27:26.931Z","closed_by":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::medium","status::confirmed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},{"id":5017256,"username":"twlostow","name":"Tomasz Wlostowski","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a91a5ffaa6c2c9f88ccfbb53b8565162?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/twlostow"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"user_notes_count":6,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1765","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":12,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1765","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1765/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1765/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1765","relative":"#1765","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1765"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":36,"epic":{"id":195460,"iid":36,"title":"Length Tuning","url":"/groups/kicad/code/-/epics/36","group_id":6593436,"human_readable_end_date":"May 15, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e14\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27932570,"iid":2883,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Launching footprint editor from PcbNew changes default units to mm (lp:#1538239)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1538239) created by **Art (diametrix)**\n```\nSeems to affect all canvases.

H-bridge. The H-bridge is\nconnected to GND rail through a shunt resistor, and the uC is meauring\nvoltage across the resistor (single-ended A/D). Without any flags I get\n\"Pin connected to some other pins but no pin to drive it\". Placing a flag\non the high-side of the shunt resistor removes this DRC-warning, but\nintroduces another one: \"Conflict problem between pins\" as the uC-pin is a\nconfigurable I/O (bi-directional).\n\nChanging the type of the uC pin is not a good option, removing the check is\nnot ideal, and allowing the warning is not good practice either.\n\nIt would be nice if one could override specific pins of a component, e.g. a\nbi-directional pin could be overridden as pure input or pure output if the\nspecific schematic requires.

Ideally this\nfeature would include some sort of text parsing utility so that the\ninformation could, as much so as possible, just be cut and pasted from the\ntable in the datasheet.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-30T04:42:39.259Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T23:01:41.519Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T08:11:45.228Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::wishlist","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1106","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":54,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1106","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1106/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1106/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1106","relative":"#1106","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1106"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27878289,"iid":1105,"project_id":15502567,"title":"PCBnew: Sending traces to the other side sometimes rotates the trace (lp:#1519601)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1519601) created by **frotz (frotz)**\n```\nIf I have a trace selected and I want to hit 'F' to send it to the other\nside, PCBnew will sometimes rotate the trace, breaking the circuit and my\nconcentration.
