patch\nhttps://git.launchpad.net/kicad/patch/?id=37741048cef0d1623d90eeed43bf537de375e938\nfor the issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1813964 appears to have\ncreated a new bug where now polylines are closed even when they shouldn't\nbe.\n\nI encountered this issue plotting an SVG of this project schematic:\nhttps://github.com/bobbarnes1981/mod_synth/tree/3c8d33dbccd27c43dd53195eee7b6646931202e2/mod_synth_seq/schematic\n\n\nAn earlier KiCad version (5.0) plotted the schematic correctly:\n\n```\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.0-3-g5ebb6b6), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.30.0 SecureTransport zlib/1.2.5\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 13.4.0

rendering with KiCad version 5.1.2 (which\nalso had another black \u0026 white SVG plotting bug):\n\n```\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.1.2-f72e74a~84~ubuntu16.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n

nightly version of KiCad and verified that the\nincorrect SVG plotting still occurs (though the other black \u0026 white\nplotting SVG bug I encountered appears to have been fixed):\n\n```\nApplication: Eeschema\nVersion: 6.0.0-unknown-8f58300~100~ubuntu18.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.58.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4

 KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\n\nHere is a partial diff between the correct plot in version 5.0 and the\nincorrect plot in 5.1.2 (note the addition of the \"Z\"):\n\n```\n@ @ -10467,19 +11446,23@ @\n \u003cg style=\"fill:#000000; fill-opacity:0.0;\n stroke:#000000; stroke-width:100; stroke-opacity:1;\n stroke-linecap:round;

in a correct plotting (for that portion\nof the component):\n\n```\n--- /\u003cpath\u003e/mod_synth_seq--kicad-linux-nightly--bw-without-title-border--\nhalf-buggy.svg        2019-08-19

that the code patch in question removed a conditional check\n(potentially due to the fact that the later \"Close/(fill) the path\" comment\ndidn't really reflect what the last piece of code was doing):\n\n```\n@ @ -492,16 +505,7@ @ void SVG_PLOTTER::PlotPoly( const\nstd::vector\u003cwxPoint\u003e\u0026 aCornerList,\n         fprintf( outputFile, \"%d,%d\\n\", (int) pos.x, (int) pos.y );\n     }\n\n-    // ensure the shape is closed, for filled shapes (that are closed\npolygons):\n-    // (svg does not close automatically a polygon\n-    if( aCornerList.front() != aCornerList.back() \u0026\u0026 aFill != NO_FILL )\n-    {\n-        pos = userToDeviceCoordinates( aCornerList.front() );\n-        fprintf( outputFile, \"%d,%d\\n\", (int) pos.x, (int) pos.y );\n-    }\n-\n-    // Close/(fill) the path\n-    fprintf( outputFile, \"\\\" /\u003e \\n\" );\n+    fprintf( outputFile, \"Z\\\" /\u003e \\n\" );\n }\n```\n\nI'm guessing but haven't verified that moving the output of the \"Z\" back\ninside the original conditional may fix the issue--but I don't know if that\nwould have any unintended consequences elsewhere.\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema export plot

(wmattanderson)**\n```\nMaybe this is intended, but if so, it is an unfortunate name. GetCenter()\nseems to return the coordinates of whatever is at 0,0 in the footprint\neditor. As far as I know that is what GetPosition() returns as well. I\nexpected it to return the geometric center of the footprint, which can be\nhad by module.GetFootprintRect().Centre(). This can easily be verified on\nany footprint which is built without the origin being at the geographical\ncenter of the footprint. Often times pin 1 is at the 0,0 of the\nfootprint(in the footprint editor).\n\nI think this is true of all versions, but for sure\nApplication: KiCad\nVersion: 5.1.3-ffb9f22~84~ubuntu18.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.58.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1 zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libpsl/0.19.1\n(+libidn2/2.0.4) nghttp2/1.30.0 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 5.0.0-25-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 3.22\n    Boost: 1.65.1\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.58.0\n    Compiler: GCC 7.4.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew python","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-16T20:23:42.417Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T20:24:42.268Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T17:00:26.583Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::low","python","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1085341,"iid":8,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0.0-rc1","description":"","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T15:46:37.423Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T03:02:43.415Z","due_date":"2021-11-30","start_date":"2020-02-01","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/8"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":4,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/1924","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1924","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1924/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/1924/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#1924","relative":"#1924","full":"kicad/code/kicad#1924"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27926360,"iid":2555,"project_id":15502567,"title":"ERC check misses pins connected via certain labels (lp:#1840496)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1840496) created by **Seth Hillbrand (sethh)**\n```\nRunning ERC check misses certain label connections.

Can you please add support for compression?\nThere are compressed versions of both VRLM and STEP, using extensions\n.wrl.gz and .stpZ, both supported by FreeCAD.\n\nI think it would make sense to support this. Maybe you can simplify and\njust use .wrl.gz and .step.gz.\n\nI suggest to implement this in such way, that user will enter path to\nuncompressed model (without \".gz\") and if there's no such file, kicad can\ntake a second look to version with \".gz\" suffix. So it will be possible to\ncompress whole library without having to change existing PCB files or\nlimiting ability to modify the models without having to recompress them\nevery time.\n\nBTW why library contains all models in two formats? Can't we just stick to\none of them? I guess that STEP is more modern, but VRLM takes 4 times less\nspace.\n```\nOriginal tags: 3d-viewer export pcbnew step","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-12T23:57:06.944Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T17:00:11.213Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T03:22:20.464Z","closed_by":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"labels":["3d-viewer","export","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed","step"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4765261,"username":"sethhillbrand","name":"Seth Hillbrand","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4765261/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/sethhillbrand"},"user_notes_count":14,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2479","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2479","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2479/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2479/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2479","relative":"#2479","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2479"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27807264,"iid":105,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Footprint text items not plotted on mask layer (lp:#1839892)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1839892) created by **Seth Hillbrand (sethh)**\n```\nIn the attached board file, there are multiple text items plotted on\nB.Mask.

cut and paste annotation lost (lp:#1839348)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1839348) created by **Dino Ghilardi (dino-ghilardi)**\n```\nCutting a part of a schematic to paste it somewhere else looses components\nannotation.\n\nTo reproduce:\n  Select a component\n  cut it with ctrl-x or right-click-menu-\u003ecut\n  paste it with ctrl-V or right-click-menu-\u003epaste.\n  The component annotation of the pasted items is lost.\n\nThis can be a problem when on complex projects you have to re-organize\nschematics but you have yet routed the board: re-annotating the components\ngenerates a schematic that is not in-sync with the pcb and re-syncronizing\nit (F8) with different annotation may be is not so easy (did not try it: I\nhave a too complex board).\n\n\nIn \"copy-paste\"operation is correct to clear components annotation, since\nwithout doing that we would end up to a \"duplicate references\", but in\n\"cut-paste\" the annotation should be kept.\n\nMay be the easiest way to handle this correctly is:\n -after a cut or copy the reference of the components in clipboard should\nbe reset only if that reference exist in the project (this handles also the\ncase where cut is followed by more than one paste)\nSince a copy does not remove the components the cut-paste, copy-paste, cut-\npaste-paste-paste, copy-paste-paste-paste... are all handled the same way.\n\nOn the 5.1.2 version the cut+paste works correctly without loosing\nannotation.\nOn the 5.1.4 version the cut+paste works correctly without loosing\nannotation.\n\nMay be this issue is related to the fix for Bug #1833205 (I did not verify\nif it is true, but that one also is about component annotation in copy-\npaste operations)\n\nCheers,\nDino.\n-----------------------------------\nApplication: Eeschema\nVersion: (5.1.0-1450-g38fc51c3b), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.52.1

5aa48e523dd46632564d3a118921f6c1f02abc2f\n\nThe released versions (Tested on 5.1.4) are not affected since they don't\nhave the \"Bus Connections\" ERC options at the bottom of the dialog.\n\nCheers,\nDino.\n-----------------------------------------------\nApplication: Eeschema\nVersion: (5.1.0-1449-g5aa48e523), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.52.1

(And possibly also some other things)\n\nIt is quite confusing right now. If i want to create gerber why would i not\nwant the drill file to be created. Yes i will want to have the same\nsettings available as with the drill dialog right now but some of them\nshould only be setable in one place. One example would be the use of the\nauxilary origin. If it is enabled in gerber then i will want it in the\ndrill and position file as well.\n\nSome of the current plot features could be either export or print options\n(export to svg instead of plot to svg. Print to pdf instead of plot pdf.)\nOr we could decide that they are simply other datatypes for the CAM export.\n\nSuch a CAM dialog could then also handle exporting and importing CAM\nsettings. And handle future more powerful data types (successors for\ngerber)\n```\nOriginal tags: export feature.request pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-08-05T14:17:53.692Z","updated_at":"2022-09-25T14:20:04.075Z","closed_at":"2022-09-25T12:07:28.508Z","closed_by":{"id":5016083,"username":"craftyjon","name":"Jon Evans","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5719485a878e3453a59a042656c9d8a3?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/craftyjon"},"labels":["export","feature-request","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::duplicate"],"milestone":{"id":2759717,"iid":19,"group_id":6593371,"title":"8.0","description":"","state":"active","created_at":"2022-09-01T14:43:30.061Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T03:31:24.174Z","due_date":"2024-09-20","start_date":"2023-01-31","expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/kicad/-/milestones/19"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":16,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":36,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2475","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":20,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2475","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2475/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2475/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2346"},"references":{"short":"#2475","relative":"#2475","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2475"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":26,"epic":{"id":95868,"iid":26,"title":"Plotting and Output Jobs","url":"/groups/kicad/code/-/epics/26","group_id":6593436,"human_readable_end_date":"Sep 20, 2024","human_readable_timestamp":"over \u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e year remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27934627,"iid":3018,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Selection highlight in eeschema is magnified after zoom (lp:#1838869)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1838869) created by **MightyPork (mighty-pork)**\n```\nA funny bug with highlights.. when you zoom in, an existing highlight is\nmagnified out of proportions.

The UI text is misleading. I have seen\nat least two threads in the user forum where a poster was confused by that,\ntrying to update footprint(s) on a board after modifying the footprint\nmodule files.\n\nThe confusion comes from using the word \"update\" in two completely\ndifferent contexts with footprints. What the \"Update PCB from Schematic\"\ndialog actually does is change (or not) the footprints if the footprint\nassociations, i.e. footprint names, have been changed in symbols of the\nschematic. I think the UI text should reflect that. The word \"update\"\nshould in my opinion be reserved for updating from the changed library\nfile.\n\nI would even go as far as to say that the dialog UI text could be \"Don't\nchange footprints\" or \"Keep old symbol/footprint associations\" or something\nlike that, and the default would be not selected.\n\nIn the minimum it should have a tooltip text which explains what it does.\nNow none of the Options has a tooltip.\n\n\nApplication: Pcbnew\nVersion: (5.1.3-7-g8373e91a1)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11
