I was sure\nthat since 5.0.0 default is Modern Toolset so didn't checked it.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (6.0.0-rc1-dev-1542-gf9f87b3ff), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-16T11:38:20.373Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:56.261Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T21:41:58.509Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::low","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/273","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/273","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/273/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/273/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#273","relative":"#273","full":"kicad/code/kicad#273"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27882113,"iid":1432,"project_id":15502567,"title":"KiCad SEGFAULT on Eagle import (lp:#1811907)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1811907) created by **Ed Cernek (ed-cernek)**\n```\nUsing MacOS 10.14.2\nUsing Eagle 7.7.0 for Mac OS X (64 bit)\nUsing KiCad Application: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.1-3-g963ef8bb5), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.54.0 LibreSSL/2.6.4 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.24.1\nPlatform: Mac OS X (Darwin 18.2.0 x86_64), 64 bit, Little endian, wxMac\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (UTF-8,STL containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.67.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.54.0\n    Compiler: Clang 10.0.0 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=ON\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n======================================\nWhen attempting to import an Eagle project I get:\n======================================\nProcess:               kicad [831]\nPath:                  /Volumes/VOLUME/*/kicad.app/Contents/MacOS/kicad\nIdentifier:            org.kicad-pcb.kicad\nVersion:               ???

footprint and switched the grid to imperial mode to get\nthe 1.27mm grid I needed. After I did this, however, I am unable to switch\nback to metric. Each time I click on the mm button it immediately toggles\nback to in.  When I saw this I abandoned the footprint I was working on and\nexited the footprint editor, not saving anything. When I re-opened the\nfootprint editor the behavior was the same. I then restarted KiCad entirely\nand it still refuses to go into metric mode in the footprint editor.\nFurthermore, I now see the same behavior in the PCB editor. It too is now\nstuck in imperial mode.\n\nI am running the latest version from OpenSUSE, 5.0.2.\n\nUnder .config/kicad/pcbnew I noticed that Units=1 and\nPcbFramePcbUserGrid_Unit=1\n. I tried setting these to zero and it made no difference.\n\nIn the pcbnew editor I can get it to switch to mm, but it flickers back and\nforth a lot until it ends up there. As soon as I click on the footprint\neditor, however, it switches back to in and the footprint editor will not\ngo into mm mode no matter what I do.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-12T06:05:47.551Z","updated_at":"2021-11-09T13:38:56.808Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T22:47:21.041Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/478","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/478","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/478/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/478/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#478","relative":"#478","full":"kicad/code/kicad#478"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27941450,"iid":3401,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Zero out symbol data fields after a symbol is copied and its value field is changed (lp:#1811460)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1811460) created by **Art (diametrix)**\n```\nThis is probably a feature request, but it would make life much easier if\nall the fields for a component (like datasheet, Description, all the custom\nfields)  are zeroed out when you edit the value field. For example if I\nwant to insert a new resistor, more often than not I would just copy and\npaste one of the resistors already placed on the schematic and then adjust\nits value by editing Value field directly.  If I don't catch it later,\nduring BOM generation, it would have a wrong part number and everything\nelse assigned to it.

What needs to happen is when\nyou go to paste the block it should be centered on the current cursor\nposition.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (6.0.0-rc1-dev-1491-g0a4812be0), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 8 (build 9200), 64-bit edition, 64 bit, Little endian,\nwxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-11T16:04:41.963Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:28:10.827Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T22:47:16.547Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::undecided","status::fix-released"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/477","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/477","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/477/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/477/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#477","relative":"#477","full":"kicad/code/kicad#477"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27941447,"iid":3400,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Add inverted logic for Layers/Items visibility (lp:#1811355)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1811355) created by **eelik (eelik)**\n```\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1796118. This is taken from there\nbecause the original idea and subject line of that report was changed. I\nthink that inverting the logic of visibility rules of the Layers Manager\nhas merit. It would allow different kinds of workflows. That should of\ncourse be optional.\n\nHere is my comment from that report:\n______________________________________\n\nPossible solution which doesn't break existing workflows or behavior:\n\nAdd \"Invert layer/item visibility logic\" checkbox to Layers Manager -\u003e\nItems list. That would invert the logic so that visibility logic would work\nlike this:\n\n1. Layers-\u003eCopper layer is unselected. So, start from \"no items visible\".\n2. Also Fab and Silk layers (for references etc.) are unselected.\n2. Items-\u003eFootprints is unselected. So, continue with \"no footprints\nvisible\".\n3. Items-\u003eReferences is selected. So, *show* references of footprints.\n4. Items-\u003ePads Front is selected. So, show front pads.\n5. Items-\u003eThrough Via is selected. So, show vias.\n\nThe result: only front pads, references and vias are visible. No other\ncopper, silk or fab items (which are unselected).\n____________________________________________\n\n\nSee also https://forum.kicad.info/t/4-0-7-is-dead-but-still-can-not-yet-\nfind-replacement/14590/24.\n\n\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (6.0.0-rc1-dev-1512-gfe30460ae), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-11T10:10:16.355Z","updated_at":"2019-12-28T16:27:36.602Z","closed_at":"2019-12-28T16:27:36.575Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::opinion"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":5,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3400","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3400","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3400/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3400/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3400","relative":"#3400","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3400"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27924188,"iid":2319,"project_id":15502567,"title":"eeschema: remap fail on symbols with deprecated chars in name (lp:#1811275)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1811275) created by **Sergey A.

Mouse is not good for work on mobile device and the\nmouse are too shaky in some cases.\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (6.0.0-rc1-dev-1455-g4b7ef22ec), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.6\nlibidn2/2.0.5 libpsl/0.20.2 (+libidn2/2.0.5) nghttp2/1.34.0\nPlatform: Windows 7 (build 7601, Service Pack 1), 64-bit edition, 64 bit,\nLittle endian, wxMSW\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8)\n    Boost: 1.68.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.61.1\n    Compiler: GCC 8.2.0 with C++ ABI 1013\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_PYTHON3=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON_PHOENIX=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-09T21:20:25.294Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:28:15.123Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T21:41:18.145Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["eeschema","priority::low","status::fix-released"],"milestone":{"id":1085265,"iid":3,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.3","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.3/+download/kicad-5.1.3.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.3/+download/kicad-5.1.3.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T14:12:22.308Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:30:15.472Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/3"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":13,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/271","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/271","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/271/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/271/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#271","relative":"#271","full":"kicad/code/kicad#271"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27924179,"iid":2317,"project_id":15502567,"title":"option for disable focus change during cross-link (lp:#1811136)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1811136) created by **NhatKhai (nhatkhai)**\n```\nI think we should have a setting in reference for disable cross-link to pan\nthe windows/change current focus in either pcbnew, or eeschema.

But here is a video of a situation into which I bump\nevery now and then with the interactive router in Shove mode.\n\nThe router suddenly finds a route which violates DRC and the angle of the\ntrack isn't n*45deg even though I have limited the angle. It kind of takes\na shortcut, the shortest distance between points A and B. I can't find the\nreason or exact situation when this happens, it just happens every now and\nthen. It has happened for a long time, it doesn't depend on some specific\nversion. IIRC I have seen this even long before 5.0.\n\nHere are some restrictions which I think apply for the situation:\n\nI have used or am using small grid, e.g. 0.05mm in this specific case.\nMaybe I have used even smaller for the same project and then changed. It\nprobably happens when I try to route to a pad, or work nearby a pad, but\nI'm not sure about this. The distance is pretty small, a couple of mm at\nmost (again IIRC).\n\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (6.0.0-rc1-dev-1491-g0a4812be0), release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n

All fp_poly sections change substantially, including removing\ncoordinates\n\nWhile the files do not appear corrupted, I think we shouldn't modify the\nfootprint coordinates and definitely not remove points unless the user\nspecifically makes that change.\n\n[1]

So if I have 4 mil spacing rules and I\nsee a 3.98 mil spacing, I know I can ignore it.  This also allows me to set\nmore restrictive rules to see if I can make changes that would aid\nmanufacturing or lower the cost.

think one of the most boring things is the absence of the representation\nof the Cartesian axes.\nOften, indeed almost always, when you have to connect a 3D object to a\nfootprint, a lot of problems arise with the positioning, especially if the\npurpose is to modify the object so that it does not need to offset the\nfootprint.\nProblems arise, in my opinion, from the absence of a representation of the\nCartesian axes and the fact that the footprint is displayed without\nignoring the rotations applied during placement on the pcb.\nThe thing that puzzles me is that if you turn the component on the pcb and\nthen edit the 3D properties, the graphic representation is strongly\nmisleading because the x and y movements are exchanged.\nI think it would be more correct to represent the 3d object on the\nfootprint without any rotations applied to the pcb or as represented in the\nfootprint editor.\n\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 6.0.0-rc1-unknown-r14713-3a3bbbb5, debug build\nLibraries:\n

However, it did not\ndo either of these things.  Instead, the ~/.config/kicad/fp-lib-table it\ncreated was identical to the project's local fp-lib-table.\n\nThis is unexpected, and undesirable, because I don't end up with any of the\nstandard KiCad libraries in my global fp-lib-table.  (And the libraries\nthat do end up in the fp-lib-table won't be meaningful in any other project\nthan the first one that I opened.)\n\nI would prefer that KiCad always set up the global fp-lib-table with the\nstandard libraries.  And if there is more than one thing it might do, it\nshould say which thing it actually did, rather than saying \"I did either\nthis or that\" and then actually doing a third thing.\n\nversion information:\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.0.2-bee76a0~70~ubuntu16.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.47.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2g zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.32 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.4.0-141-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.58.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.47.0\n    Compiler: GCC 5.4.0 with C++ ABI 1009\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-12-31T18:33:25.314Z","updated_at":"2021-11-06T19:45:12.795Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T12:10:25.646Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["priority::medium","status::duplicate"],"milestone":{"id":1085250,"iid":1,"project_id":15502567,"title":"5.1.0","description":"[https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz](https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0/+download/kicad-5.1.0.tar.xz)","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-01T13:50:39.904Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T20:27:50.544Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/1"},"assignees":[{"id":4725252,"username":"stambaughw","name":"Wayne Stambaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4725252/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stambaughw"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4725252,"username":"stambaughw","name":"Wayne Stambaugh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4725252/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/stambaughw"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/657","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/657","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/657/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/657/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#657","relative":"#657","full":"kicad/code/kicad#657"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27933146,"iid":2919,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Report not found symbol libs at the end rather than reporting everyone and stop loading (lp:#1810161)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1810161) created by **Rene Poeschl (poeschlr)**\n```\nRight now it seems like the loading process stops if it encounters a\nmissing lib.

Symbol Library not initialized properly if first project opened is an existing project with project specific libraries (lp:#1809769)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1809769) created by **drojf (drojfjord)**\n```\nNormally, after you install kicad, and create a new project, then open the\nschematic editor, you'll get the \"Configure Global Symbol Library Table\"\ndialog. This will then initialize your symbol library table to the\ndefaults.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nIf you open a project with project specific libraries after installing\nKicad, and choose to copy default libraries, the Global Symbol Library\nTable should contain the default libraries.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\nIf you open a project with project specific libraries after installing\nKicad, the Global Symbol Library Table will contain the \"Project Specific\nLibraries\" from the first project you open. None of default libraries are\ncopied.\n\nIf you open a project without project specific libraries, it seems to work\nOK\n\nEDIT:\nI just noticed that the project specific libraries are stored in a file\ncalled \"sym-lib-table\" in the project directory. I managed to reproduce the\nissue even if there are no project specific libraries in the project, as\nlong as you have a \"sym-lib-table\" in your project folder containing no\nentries in it. So I'm guessing Kicad is copying this file and using it as\nthe global defaults.\n\nReproduction instructions:\n\n- With a working copy of Kicad, create a schematic project which has at\nleast one Project Specific library. I have provided two example projects\nwhich cause the problem, just in case it's something to do with my setup\nspecifically. In my examples, the project specific library is located\nadjacent to the project files (if that makes a difference).\n\n- Delete or rename your 'global libraries' folder to simulate a fresh\ninstall of Kicad. I'm on windows, so I delete the folder\n`C:\\Users\\drojf\\AppData\\Roaming\\kicad`. (Alternatively, do a fresh install\nof Kicad on a machine which hasn't ever had Kicad installed.)\n\n- Open the schematic project which was created earlier. This should cause\nthe 'Configure Global Symbol Library Table' dialog to pop up. Choose the\ndefault option, \"Copy default global symbol library table (recommended)\".\n\n- Now if you check the \"Global Libraries\", it will contain the \"Project\nSpecific Libraries\" from the project you just opened, instead of the\n\"default\" Global Libraries. The global libraries will remain this way, even\nafter closing and opening Kicad again or making a new project.\n\nNOTE: I delete the 'global libraries' folder to simulate having installed\nKicad from scratch, but I've seen it happen numerous times before when\ninstalling Kicad the first time 'for real'.\n\nI remember this happening in previous Kicad versions, I don't think it was\nintroduced in this particular build of Kicad.\n\nVersion Information:\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: (5.0.2)-1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1 (WinSSL) zlib/1.2.11

video.\n\nBest regards,\nJulien FAUCHER\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 6.0.0-rc1-unknown-a3d8ab9~84~ubuntu18.10.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.61.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1
