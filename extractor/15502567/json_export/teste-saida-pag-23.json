hierarchical sheet destroys reference designators (lp:#1789048)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1789048) created by **Ron Burkey (rburkey)**\n```\n(I am using the KiCad 6.0.0-rc1 nightly build.)\n\nWhen you create a hierarchical sheet in eeschema using a child schematic\nsheet that already exists (as opposed to letting eeschema create a new,\nempty child sheet for you), all of the reference designators that already\nexist within the child sheet will be destroyed the first time you do a Save\nof the design.\n\nThis can be rather distressing if you've put a lot of effort into getting\nthe reference designators just the way you need them.  I understand that\nthis behavior is probably there in the expectation that multiple copies of\nthe same hierarchical block will be used, and will hence need to be\nreannotated, but that's not the only use case.  In the use case of a simple\nmulti-sheet design in which none of the sheets appears more than once\n(which is my use case), it is less likely to be the desired behavior.\n\nThere's a pop-up box that appears when you create the hierarchical sheet\nwhich says something to the effect that \"X.sch already exists. Link to this\nfile?\".  I think that this pop-up box should:\n\na) Warn you that linking to the existing sheet will destroy all of its\nreference designators;\nb) Tell you that this destruction of refd's cannot be undone; and\nb) Offer the option of leaving all of the reference designators intact\ninstead of destroying them.\n\nThere are workarounds, namely copying an intact child sheet back into place\nafter the hierarchical-sheet-creation operation has destroyed the refd's in\nthe first copy, but I still think that at least a warning would still be\nuseful.\n```\nOriginal tags:

I need to re-order the units of a couple of quad-op amps.  Ideally,\nchanging the unit in one sheet would change the identical unit in all of\nthe copies of that sub-sheet.  Maybe the solution is a menu-option\n(propagate multi-unit ordering?) that can synchronize the items.\n\nNaively, I expected the annotation option \"Reset existing annotations\" to\nclear the unit letters as well because we also have the option \"Reset, but\nkeep order of multi-unit parts\".  But it didn't and doesn't seem to have a\ndifferent action.

(lp:#1788676)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1788676) created by **Steve Wood (steve+ubuntu)**\n```\nIt is critical in my opinion to be able to reliably get a .raw file from a\nsimulation run for use in a full-featured 3rd party waveform viewer,\nespecially since the built-in KiCAD viewer is still young and missing some\nessential features (waveform expressions, subplots, zoom-undo, etc.).\n\nUsing \".control ... .endc\" on the schematic doesn't always produce a\nrawfile, and if it does, the simulation must be often run twice to get a\nvalid .raw file.\n\nPlease see\nhttps://forum.kicad.info/t/how-can-i-generate-a-raw-file-for-use-in-a-3rd-\nparty-waveform-viewer/12119/23?u=steve_kicad\n\nIn particular, the message from Holger:\n\"In fact adding a .control section to the eeschema generated netlist may\nraise some caveats.\n\nIt is largely untested in this environment (shared ngspice, simulation\ncalled by bg_run in a second thread) and thus bears some risk due to the\nmultithreading involved. It may happen that the write command starts before\nthe simulation has finished, then writing the old data.\n\nIt might be much better that the eeschema interface handles all the issues\ndirectly and care for thread synchronization. This has to be coded into\neeschema. Therefore it is necessary to notify the KiCad developers and add\nthese issues to the wishlist.\"\n\n**********************************************\n\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.0.0-fee4fd1~66~ubuntu18.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.4\n    libcurl/7.58.0 OpenSSL/1.1.0g zlib/1.2.11 libidn2/2.0.4 libpsl/0.19.1\n(+libidn2/2.0.4) nghttp2/1.30.0 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.15.0-32-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.4 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.65.1\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.9.1\n    Curl: 7.58.0\n    Compiler: GCC 7.3.0 with C++ ABI 1011\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n```\nOriginal tags: eeschema export ngspice","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-23T18:52:03.999Z","updated_at":"2019-12-21T22:52:17.846Z","closed_at":"2019-12-21T22:52:17.813Z","closed_by":{"id":2680238,"username":"michaelkavanagh","name":"Michael Kavanagh","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2680238/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/michaelkavanagh"},"labels":["eeschema","export","ngspice","priority::wishlist","status::confirmed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":11,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2221","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2221","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2221/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2221/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2221","relative":"#2221","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2221"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27879634,"iid":1253,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Pcbnew: Double click on DRC Problem/Marker hides DRC window (lp:#1788635)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1788635) created by **Fabián Inostroza (fabianinostroza)**\n```\nHovering on a item in the list of problems/markers suggest to double click\nto go to the location of the problem in the PCB, doing so also hides the\nDRC window, having to click again in the DRC tool to continue the check.

The effect, of course, is that when you move the object\nyou've grabbed, you inadvertently move the image as well.

In other words, the image has\nalready moved to a new location within the sheet when M is hit, even before\nthe user tries to move the mouse.

face is length matching nets and\nnet groups. We need to length match across layers, and to different target\nskews.\n\nWhat we are looking for is a mechanism to specify all the target lengths\nfor various nets in one location or dialog box, and, critically, have Kicad\ncalculate the total net length while taking into account the stack up\ndimensions and layer height.\n\nThere are three elements to this request then;\n\n1) A dialog box where we can specify the target length for specific nets\n\n2) A location where we can specify stack up geometry (related to\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/1783135)\n\n3) Update the length matching calculator to account for the stack up when\ncalculating target lengths.\n\n---\n\nRight now, we have to do all the length matching in a spread sheet, making\nlater modifications very fragile and error prone. Our boards are fairly\ncomplex, with a substantial amount of length matching; this feature would\nsave us considerable work.\n```\nOriginal tags: pcbnew pns","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-17T18:15:39.356Z","updated_at":"2023-04-07T15:51:54.453Z","closed_at":"2023-04-07T15:51:54.427Z","closed_by":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"labels":["pcbnew","priority::wishlist","router","status::confirmed"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":null,"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/2213","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":6,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2213","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2213/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/2213/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#2213","relative":"#2213","full":"kicad/code/kicad#2213"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":36,"epic":{"id":195460,"iid":36,"title":"Length Tuning","url":"/groups/kicad/code/-/epics/36","group_id":6593436,"human_readable_end_date":"May 15, 2023","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003e14\u003c/strong\u003e days remaining"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27878578,"iid":1158,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Through hole  footprint only snaps to its own cupper layer (lp:#1787627)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1787627) created by **Carloszelayeta (carloszelayeta)**\n```\nWhen using a through hole component, you can only snap to the tracks of the\nlayer where the component is placed.

(lp:#1787073)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1787073) created by **Robert (robee)**\n```\nHi,\n\nWhen I’m routing a board, I move from layer to layer a lot, to see where I\nhave space for routing on a layer (in high contrast mode), and to specify\nwhich layer a route should continue on after placing a via or routing from\na pin. To make this easier, I’ve changed the hotkeys that switch to a\nspecific layer more intuitive to me. Specifically, I’ve set T for top, B\nfor bottom, 1 to switch to inner layer 1, 2 for inner layer 2, etc. This\nworks well for me (and I would think everyone else), except Pcbnew only has\nhotkeys for switching up to inner layer 6 while I have 8 inner layers.\n\nI'd like more layer change hotkeys, the ability to add an arbitrary number\nof hotkeys to change layers, or some way to combine a hotkey and a number\nto go to a particular layer.  For example, in PADS, the hotkey 'z' is used\nto display layers.  'Z 1 2 3' displays layers 1, 2, and 3.  I prefer the\nspeed of simply pressing a single number to change to a layer, but at 13\nlayers, that method fails.  Of course, being able to deal with 12 layers is\nstill much better than the 8 we have currently available, so I'd be\nsatisfied with adding hotkeys to move to 10 internal layers.\n\nAnother possible solution to this is the ability to program a new hotkey\nwith a particular function.  It would be something like a macro programmed\nto a single key.  I don't think this ability already exists, but if such a\nfeature did exist, I would use it to program a hotkey to change to a\nparticular layer.\n\nI know that there is a layer manager window on the right, but I find that\nto be awkward when in the middle of a route. Plus, switching layers seems\nlike a more basic function needing a hotkey than say, tuning a differential\npair.\n\nThanks!\n```\nOriginal tags: hotkeys pcbnew","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-08-15T02:37:45.322Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T22:04:20.866Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T13:42:00.082Z","closed_by":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"labels":["hotkeys","pcbnew","priority::wishlist","status::fix-committed"],"milestone":{"id":1341197,"iid":15,"project_id":15502567,"title":"6.0 Feature Freeze","description":"Feature freeze is the point at which no new features are accepted, and we switch gears to bug fixing in preparation for a release","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-25T21:46:48.705Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T12:33:52.118Z","due_date":"2020-12-31","start_date":"2019-12-04","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/milestones/15"},"assignees":[{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"}],"author":{"id":5015372,"username":"kicad-bot","name":"KiCad Bot","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015372/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad-bot"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":5015694,"username":"jeffyoung","name":"Jeff Young","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/5015694/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/jeffyoung"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/3102","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3102","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3102/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567/issues/3102/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/15502567","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#3102","relative":"#3102","full":"kicad/code/kicad#3102"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":27875681,"iid":880,"project_id":15502567,"title":"Grid  \"Fast Switching\" doesn't work in footprint editor (lp:#1787066)","description":"[Original report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1787066) created by **Gabriel Staples (ercaguy)**\n```\nApplication: kicad\nVersion: 5.0.0-fee4fd1~65~ubuntu14.04.1, release build\nLibraries:\n    wxWidgets 3.0.2\n    libcurl/7.35.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1f zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.28 librtmp/2.3\nPlatform: Linux 4.4.0-112-generic x86_64, 64 bit, Little endian, wxGTK\nBuild Info:\n    wxWidgets: 3.0.2 (wchar_t,wx containers,compatible with 2.8) GTK+ 2.24\n    Boost: 1.54.0\n    OpenCASCADE Community Edition: 6.8.0\n    Curl: 7.35.0\n    Compiler: GCC 4.8.4 with C++ ABI 1002\n\nBuild settings:\n    USE_WX_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT=OFF\n    USE_WX_OVERLAY=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF\n    KICAD_SCRIPTING_ACTION_MENU=ON\n    BUILD_GITHUB_PLUGIN=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCE=ON\n    KICAD_USE_OCC=OFF\n    KICAD_SPICE=ON\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nLooking at View --\u003e Grid Settings…\n\nThere is a “Fast Switching” Grid 1 and Grid 2 option.

This\nlimit is sometimes too severe in the case in which the multiple parts are\nindividual pins of a single large connector.\n\nIn one schematic I am working on right now, for example, there is a 124-pin\nconnector which must be presented on the schematic as 124 individual\nconnector pins.

(valerio.new)**\n```\nThis is the scenario i faced this evening:\n\nI was working on a footprint in the footprint editor. I had some unsaved\nprogresses.\nI go into pcbnew to compare my work against some similar footprints. I try\nto measure a feature on the footprint but i realize that opening the\nfootprint in the editor would have made my measurement much easier. So i go\ninto footprint properties, click \"Footprint editor\" and it opens the new\nfootprint in the editor, losing all the progress made with the one i was\nworking with. Without even asking \"There are some unsaved changes, do you\nwant to discard them?\"\n\nThis looks a pretty serious flaw to me. Because usually if you open another\nfootprint it asks if the user wants to save the current footprint before.\n\nI was able to reproduce this bug all the times.\n\nRunning on kicad 5.0.0, windows 10.
