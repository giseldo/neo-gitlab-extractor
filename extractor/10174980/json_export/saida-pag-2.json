Since MRs originate from the contributor's repo, Gitlab CI is run from their repo as well. This means that unless it is specially configured on their end, they will be making use of shared runners for the entirety of the MR, and only when they merge to master will their code be verified by the main repo's CI.\n\nThis has always been an issue I think. As you can see [here](https://gitlab.com/zesterer/fresh/-/jobs/200371247), at the top it is using `docker-auto-scale ed2dce3a`, which is a shared runner, not our runner. This means much longer build times, as it has to compile without the cache our runners have.\n\nGitlab has known about this problem with their paradigm for a bit, but they haven't come up with a good solution yet. You can see the current status here,\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21991\n\nCurrently, I see a few options.\n\n1. Give instructions to all contributors on how to disable shared runners, and enable ours. This solution is mediocre, as it has a few downsides,\n- Getting users to go through the process could be a hassle on the debugging side if something goes wrong\n- This is assuming that each contributor has an up to date version of `gitlab-ci.yaml`. If they don't, then they won't be running the same CI as the main repo, which could lead to issues after merging.\n\n2. Get contributors to make branches and work on master. Again, a mediocre solution, but I think it has more positives than negatives.\n\n|       Pros;\n- CI on MRs will always be the same\n- People can see what branches and code is being worked on\n\n|       Cons;\n- Lots of branches could clutter up the repo\n- Need to give developer access to everyone who wants to work on Veloren\n\nI haven't found any more solutions, but I'll keep reading about what other companies have done.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-04-27T22:03:32.954Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T11:12:08.956Z","closed_at":"2019-04-28T22:31:13.506Z","closed_by":{"id":495727,"username":"AngelOnFira","name":"Forest Anderson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/495727/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AngelOnFira"},"labels":[],"milestone":{"id":846469,"iid":1,"project_id":10174980,"title":"0.2","description":"`0.2` will be the first release of Veloren that makes use of the new engine.

Some individuals compiling and connecting for the first time will run into a client / server timeout while transitioning from the Login to the Character Selection screen.\n\nThe bug is that the UI images for character selection are loaded on the main event loop. This halts client/server polling so the server times out and disconnects the client.\n\nOrder of events:\n*  voxygen/src/menu/main/mod.rs: `MainMenuState::play` is handling UI events. As the player clicks Login, `CharSelectionState::new` is called to initialize the character selection UI. This is called within the UI event handling.\n*  voxygen/src/menu/char_selection/mod.rs: `CharSelectionState::new` calls `CharSelectionUi::new`.\n*  voxygen/src/menu/char_selection/ui.rs: `CharSelectionUi::new` calls `Imgs::new`.\n*  voxygen/src/menu/char_selection/ui.rs: `Imgs::new` loads 61 images. This takes some time, holding up the UI event loop and preventing the client from sending keep-alives.\n\nPossible solution:\n*  `CharSelectionState::play` handles this new window's event loop. Add code to the beginning to spawn the `CharSelectionUi::new` logic in a new thread (recommend rename of this method from new to load_async?). While CharSelectionUi is loading, alternate between polling it state for completion and handling the client.
