I asked him what features were high priority to implement, and this was his response: \n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003eMisterTeapot's response\u003c/summary\u003e\n    \u003cpre\u003e\nThanks @AᎬᏒᎾᏁᎥᏟ [UTC-5], we're super excited!  Ok, so here's a few super quick notes regarding our potential audio system. Obviously there's a ton of room for expansion and clarification here, but this is probably a decent starting point for discussion. Implementation wise, I think our audio would loosely fall into four groups:\n\nMusic\nEnvironment SFX\nEvent SFX\nMenu/GUI SFX\n\nMusic\n\n-Typically streamed\n-Needs to have some sort of tagging system for jukebox, ie, \"exploring\", \"battle\", \"town\", \"dungeon\"\n-Needs to be able to cross-fade or at least fade out/fade in when changing areas\n-Given how much content is already finished in this area, dynamic/procedural music is likely out of scope\n\n\nEnvironment SFX\n\n-Loaded into memory on area load\n-Ambient loops for each major area type, ie, gentle breeze with leaves rustling in forest, stonger wind in mountains\n-Support for positional audio such as flowing water, bird chirps\n\nEvent SFX\n\n-Loaded with corresponding entity instantiation\n-Footsteps, glide loop, combat sounds, item interaction sounds (ie opening doors/chests), etc\n-Will need some very basic DSP, ie random ranged pitch for footsteps, pitch/EQ for glide loop\n\n\nMenu/GUI SFX\n\n-Tied to input triggers, (click/confirm, scroll, mouse over etc. need trigger list from UI team)\n-Usually these get loaded once, and then called from pool\n-Depending on how 'Juicy' we go with UI design, may require animation tagging (although we can probably fake it)\n-Dialog system probably fits in here as well, assuming that we're doing dialog boxes and not full voice-over\n-Dialog could be as simple as clicks/keystrokes as the words scroll, or more complex sythesis ala Animal Crossing\n    \u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nThis issue is for further discussion on the overarching audio system design.\n\nFrom reading his response and what I've gathered from reading on the topic, I've made a list of features that need to be implemented. As we decide we are ready to add the feature, we can make an issue, link to it, and once it is finished we can check it off.\n\n* [x] An audio description file (probably in the .ron format) (SFX: !563)\n* [ ] A way to mark audio as streaming vs. loaded into memory\n* [ ] Audio banks that can be loaded and unloaded\n* [x] Fade in, fade out, crossfade\n* [ ] Pitch shifting\n* [ ] Possibly a dynamic/procedural music engine\n* [x] A way to tag music based on the context it should be played in\n* [x] Positional audio\n\nI am ignoring the audio that should be added to the game in this issue and focusing solely on the programming.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-09-06T11:35:29.298Z","updated_at":"2022-04-17T18:17:49.571Z","closed_at":"2022-04-17T18:17:49.556Z","closed_by":{"id":495727,"username":"AngelOnFira","name":"Forest Anderson","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/495727/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/AngelOnFira"},"labels":["category::assets","category::client","category::voxygen","stale","status::ready","type::feature","wg::audio"],"milestone":{"id":1150316,"iid":7,"project_id":10174980,"title":"Veloren beyond - Long term goals","description":"Mostly tracking issues which track long term features of Veloren.\r\nIncase all of them gets completed we have reached a big milestone!","state":"active","created_at":"2020-02-09T20:04:59.315Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T20:04:59.315Z","due_date":null,"start_date":null,"expired":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren/-/milestones/7"},"assignees":[{"id":660347,"username":"desttinghim","name":"Desttinghim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/660347/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/desttinghim"}],"author":{"id":660347,"username":"desttinghim","name":"Desttinghim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/660347/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/desttinghim"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":660347,"username":"desttinghim","name":"Desttinghim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/660347/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/desttinghim"},"user_notes_count":1,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren/-/issues/239","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":8,"completed_count":4},"weight":10,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10174980/issues/239","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10174980/issues/239/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10174980/issues/239/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/10174980","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#239","relative":"#239","full":"veloren/veloren#239"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":24513683,"iid":238,"project_id":10174980,"title":"Add worker for `Chunk` optimisation","description":"_I write this issue as if !475 has already been merged._\n\nA worker, running in the thread pool, should be implemented that _optimises_ the loaded `Chunk`s.\nSuch an optimisation is comprised of:\n\n1.
