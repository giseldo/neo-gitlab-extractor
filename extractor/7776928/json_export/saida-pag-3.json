We then ask the ~frontend manager to schedule them.\n1. ~bug with with no severity and priority labels. We then ask the ~frontend manager to schedule them.\n\n## Improvements \n1. [x] With Product Managers grooming their features continuously we should consider changing section `1.` to narrow down only ~feature with ~customer. Continue to ask them to be scheduled.\n1. [x] With ~Quality handling triage level 1 which includes adding a severity label, we should change section `2.` and `3.` to just ~bug without a milestone. Ask the EM to ensure that the priority is correct or set and schedule a milestone. Maintain 15 max count and prioritize ~bug with ~customer first. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/merge_requests/140\n1. [x] Include a report on bugs that is past their SLO https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/issues/137\n1. [x] Include heat map on all ~bug for that area. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/issues/166\n1. [x] Update handbook triage package information.\n\n## Format\n\nHi, `PM_PLACEHOLDER` `FE_EM_PLACEHOLDER` `BE_EM_PLACEHOLDER`\nThis is a group or stage level triage package that aims to summarize the feature proposals and bugs which have not been scheduled or triaged. For more information please refer to the handbook:\n - https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/triage-operations/#current-packages\n\nScheduling the workload is a collaborative effort by the Product Managers and Engineering Managers for that group. Please work together to provide a best estimate on priority and milestone assignments. For each issue please:\n - Determine if the issue should be closed if it is no longer relevant or a duplicate.\n - If it is still relevant please assign either a best estimate versioned milestone, the %Backlog or the %\"Awaiting further demand\" milestone.\n - Specifically for ~bug, if there is no priority or clarity on a versioned milestone, please add a Priority label. Priority labels have an estimate SLO attached to them and help team members and the wider community understand roughly when it will be considered to be scheduled.\n   - `LINK_TO_PRIORITY_DEFINITION`\n - Once a milestone has been assigned please check off the box for that issue.\n - Please work with your team to complete the list by the due date set.\n\n\n### Heat map report\n\nHere is a heat map report on the distribution of open ~bug for your area.\n\n```\nAdd heatmap\n```\n\n### Feature Proposal section\n\nFor the following feature proposals. Please either close or assign either a versioned milestone, the %Backlog or the %\"Awaiting further demand\" milestone.\n\n#### Unscheduled ~feature with ~customer \n\n``` \nLists customer feature proposals with no milestones\nLimit: 15 issues\n```\n#### Unscheduled ~feature (non customer)\n\n```\nLists feature proposals with no milestones\nLimit: 15 issues\n```\n\n### Bug section\n\nFor the following bugs. Please either close or assign either a versioned milestone, the %Backlog or the %\"Awaiting further demand\" milestone and ensure that a priority label is set.\n\n#### Unscheduled ~frontend ~bug with ~customer \n\n```Lists customer bugs for frontend with no milestone\nLimit: 15 issues\n```\n#### Unscheduled ~frontend ~bug (non customer) \n\n```Lists bugs for frontend with no milestone in the project\nLimit: 15 issues\n```\n\n#### Unscheduled ~bug with ~customer \n\n```Lists customer bugs without frontend with no milestone\nLimit: 15 issues\n```\n\n#### Unscheduled ~bug (non customer) \n\n```Lists bugs without frontend with no milestone\nLimit: 15 issues\n```\n\n#### ~bug with Missed SLO target section\n\n```Lists bugs that have passed their priority related SLO threshold\nLimit: P1 and P2\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-13T20:05:01.288Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T10:44:21.617Z","closed_at":"2019-08-02T22:36:08.993Z","closed_by":{"id":2097582,"username":"meks","name":"Mek Stittri","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2097582/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meks"},"labels":["Quality","triage policy","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":693521,"iid":35,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/08/22/gitlab-12-2-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:48:32.567Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:20.799Z","due_date":"2019-08-22","start_date":"2019-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/35"},"assignees":[{"id":419655,"username":"markglenfletcher","name":"Mark Fletcher","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/419655/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markglenfletcher"}],"author":{"id":2097582,"username":"meks","name":"Mek Stittri","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2097582/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meks"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":419655,"username":"markglenfletcher","name":"Mark Fletcher","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/419655/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/markglenfletcher"},"user_notes_count":28,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/issues/186","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":5,"completed_count":5},"weight":7,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/186","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/186/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/186/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#186","relative":"#186","full":"gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops#186"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":1362,"epic":{"id":7636,"iid":1362,"title":"Triage automation for customer bugs","url":"/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1362","group_id":9970,"human_readable_end_date":"Feb 17, 2021","human_readable_timestamp":"\u003cstrong\u003ePast due\u003c/strong\u003e"},"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":21830077,"iid":179,"project_id":7776928,"title":"Consolidate labels for marking issues that are open for community contributions","description":"### Problem\n\nThe ~\"Accepting merge requests\" label which is mostly used for making it easier to [contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/) by marking issues that are open for community contributions.\n\nThis is interfered, most probably unintentionally, by similar labels like the [Accepting Merge Requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026subscribed=\u0026search=Accepting) label in the [`omnibus-gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab) project (see  related [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Accepting+Merge+Requests)) and the [Accepting community contributions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/-/labels?utf8=✓\u0026subscribed=\u0026search=Accepting) label in the [`design.gitlab.com`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com) project (see related [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Accepting+community+contributions)).\n\n\n### Proposal\n\n1.

Also let's stop using the word \"team\" we need to be clear on the terminology.\n\nLet's reuse the mechanism from enforcing stage labels. \n\n## Proposal\n* Singularity on **Stages** and **Groups** will be built-in with scoped labels.\n  * **Stages** ~\"devops::plan\", ~\"devops::create\", etc.\n  * **Groups** ~\"group::source code\" ~\"group::knowledge\" ~\"group::editor\", etc.\n* Improving the hygiene accounting on `group::xxx` labels\n  * For un-labeled MRs we should be able to infer from a team member mapping in `team.yml` at that point in time to the `group::xxx`. This would also solve the case when engineers move from group to group since the label preserves that mapping at that point in time.\n  * We will not auto label things that are corrected by a human or if the label is already present. \n  * If data is not present in `team.yml` we should introduce a structure there\n* Improving the hygiene accounting to `devops:xxx` labels\n  * If there is category label, map to the stage of category label.\n  * If there is only group label, we will not auto label, as the group label could belong to an MR author who is working outside of their stage \n  * We will not auto label things that are corrected by a human or if the label is already present. \n* Stretch: Auto add specialty label and either ~frontend / ~backend \n\n## Solution\n\nFirst we attempt to add **group label** based on the MR author in `pre-hygiene` stage. This would set the stage for `stage-and-group-labels-hygiene` whereby most MRs would have **group label** set either manually or inferred from the MR author.\n\nThe next `stage-and-group-labels-hygiene` job will then attempt to infer the remaining labels based on this table:\n\n| # | has_stage_label? | has_group_label? | has_category_labels? | group_is_part_of_stage? | inference_strategy|\n| -- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ | ------ |\n| 1 | true | true | true | N.A | Not needed |\n| 2 | true | true | false | true | infer category from group |\n| 3 | true | true | false | false | do not infer category - too many categories per stage to infer reliably | \n| 4 | true | false | true | N.A | infer group from category or stage | \n| 5 | false | true | true | N.A | infer stage from category | \n| 6 | false | true | false | N.A | do not infer stage and category | \n| 7 | false | false | false | N.A | Not possible to infer | \n\n## Work to do\n- [x] Create a new entry point for MR label inference based on above\n- [x] Create new job in `pre-hygiene` to add group label based on MR author\n- [ ] Use new entry point in MR label
