[{"id":34232373,"iid":470,"project_id":7776928,"title":"Audit the current group definition for group triage reports","description":"Now who should be assigned and mentioned were defined at [lib/group_definition.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blob/master/lib/group_definition.rb), and some groups were outdated from the information written on [Product sections, stages, groups, and categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/).\n\nOne example mentioned at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/merge_requests/483#note_334640221 that ~\"group::threat management\"  was renamed to ~\"group::threat insights\", and we need to reflect that.\n\nI'll go over it and also split engineering managers so we can reuse better for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/merge_requests/483\n\nFor example, change this:\n\n``` ruby\ndef group_analytics\n  {\n    mentions: %w[@dennis @djensen @npost @jshackelford @wortschi],\n    assignees: %w[@dennis @djensen @jshackelford @wortschi],\n    labels: ['group::analytics']\n  }\nend\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n``` ruby\ndef group_analytics\n  {\n    pm: %w[@jshackelford],\n    em: %w[@wortschi @djensen],\n    product_design: %w[@npost],\n    labels: ['group::analytics']\n  }\nend\n```\n\nI am confused if `@dennis` is a frontend engineering manager for this group, so I think I might need to ask a lot of people for confirming the new list...\n\n/cc

forum](https://forum.gitlab.com) and [support channels](https://about.gitlab.com/support/#contact-support). We recognize that the Support Forum issue tracker has not received much attention in the last few months, and want to redirect our community members to locations that are regularly monitored by GitLab staff.\n\nAs a result, we are closing all issues.\n\nIf the issue you're facing is a *reproducible* bug, please search for an existing issue on the [GitLab project tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues) or [file a bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/new?issuable_template=Bug).\n\nIf you are still encountering an issue, please raise a new one in the [appropriate place](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support-forum/-/blob/master/README.md) and link back to the closed issue if there's any important context that should be preserved.\n\nThe current project will become a read-only project with an [updated Readme](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support-forum/-/blob/master/README.md) on where to raise new issues.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n  \n\n## Open Questions\n\n- [x] Is `updated_at` for the issue sufficient? This is [available through `gitlab-triage`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-triage#date-condition) and would make the policy simpler. \n- [x] Are support forum issues being moved to gitlab-org/gitlab or closed? Based on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/issues/1346#note_283532621 it seems move but I'm not sure that's the right action for every support-forum

On the 17th when the milestone expires. \n1. When we release on the 22nd.\n\nCurrently, there is still a possibility of things being part of the release even if the issue is closed after the 17th but before the 22nd. This is due to the time window between these 2 dates. There is confusion due to bot labeling. Some ~\"missed-deliverable\" are still being delivered since labeling on the 17th was too soon. After discussing with @marin the general idea is to leave the milestone as they are and tack on the additional buffer with the bot labelling.\n\n\nUntil we can actually infer via automation, how every change makes it through to production, we have the below as an iteration.\n\n### Proposal \n\nLabel ~\"missed-deliverable\" and `missed:x.y` version on the last business day before the 22nd.\n* If the 22nd falls on a friday, we label this on thursday the 21th.\n* If the 22nd falls on a monday, we label this on friday the 19th.\n* If the 22nd falls on either weekend days, we label this on friday the 21th or the 20th.\n\nThis labeling will happen on the last business day at midnight pacific time. \n\n#### Implementation\n\nFor the logic, we are already pulling from the milestone dates. I am proposing that this should be an addon so we still rely on what is in `gitlab-org` milestones but calculate it in respect to the 22nd. \n\n* From a given milestone, find the last day (expire date) that will give us the month/year.\n* From the month/year look up what day is the 21st of that month/year. \n  * If the 21st is a weekday, bot runs labelling on that day.\n  * If the 21st is sunday, bot runs labelling on the 19th.\n  * If the 21st is saturday, bot runs labelling on the 20th.\n\n\nThoughts @godfat @gl-quality/eng-prod ?\n\ncc @marin @gitlab-org/delivery","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-11-04T07:37:50.078Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T22:59:23.849Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T16:57:01.228Z","closed_by":{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle Wiebers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303148/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kwiebers"},"labels":["Engineering Productivity","type::feature"],"milestone":{"id":891796,"iid":39,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.5","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/11/22/gitlab-12-5-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-05-31T08:38:03.087Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:27:03.474Z","due_date":"2019-11-17","start_date":"2019-10-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/39"},"assignees":[{"id":423915,"username":"godfat","name":"Lin Jen-Shin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8c73dab2ecd23d5b5627a0235ae2f9b1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/godfat"},{"id":461042,"username":"caalberts","name":"Albert Salim","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/461042/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/caalberts"},{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle Wiebers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303148/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kwiebers"}],"author":{"id":2097582,"username":"meks","name":"Mek Stittri","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2097582/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/meks"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":423915,"username":"godfat","name":"Lin Jen-Shin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8c73dab2ecd23d5b5627a0235ae2f9b1?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/godfat"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":3,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/issues/356","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":3,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/356","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/356/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/356/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#356","relative":"#356","full":"gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops#356"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":26538049,"iid":353,"project_id":7776928,"title":"Setup Search team triage report and make Changzheng Liu, the new EM of Search, a recipient of `group::search` triage report","description":"## Summary\n\nSearch team is new.

We need to clarify this.\r\n\r\nFor the distinction between **Category** and **Feature**, see https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy\r\n\r\nThere is no official naming/color convention for these labels but an ongoing normalization proposal with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/merge_requests/169 suggest to leverage scoped labels.\r\n\r\nI don't think scoped labels are useful here and they even prevent some existing workflow (e.g. having an [epic related to multiple categories](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/971)). Requiring to split into sub-epics/issues will generate unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\nNB:  There is a dedicated proposal to normalize feature labels: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/issues/247, this issue focuses on feature labels. \r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nIssues/Epics are not only about product/category strategies, but there are also engineering initiatives and some of them cover multiples categories depending on how the code is structured. E.g. in ~\"devops::secure\" we have a lot of overlapping areas between the groups and categories as the code is generic. One unique change to the code can impact several categories.\r\n\r\nThis MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/14376 impacts 4 categories.\r\n\r\n**Without scoped labels:** \r\n\r\n- we can have 1 epic, 1 issue, 1 MR, all labeled with the 4 category labels. Simple and straightforward.\r\n\r\n**With scoped labels:**\r\n\r\n- we need 1 parent epic, 4 child epics, 4 issues, all labeled independently with 1 category label.\r\n- the MR can't have the category labels reflecting the change it's providing.\r\n- these are way too much useless items to maintain. Engineers need to update `workflow::xxx` labels and close issues after deployed and tested on prod.

RUN_DAILY and RUN_WEEKLY","description":"On !195, we found that the naming of the variables for `RUN_DAILY` and `RUN_WEEKLY` were named in an unclear manner. These variables are important to help group jobs into a collection to run within a single pipeline execution. \n\nFrom what I can tell, here's what what policies are run behind those two variables. Everything else seems to run in a `RUN_SINGLE` pipeline.\n\n## Run daily\n- [Label reminders](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/labels-reminders.yml)\n- [Stage and group label hygiene](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/stage-and-group-labels-hygiene.yml)\n- [MR migrate legacy labels](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/mr-migrate-legacy-labels.yml)\n- [Accepting merge requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/label-accepting-merge-requests.yml)\n- [Move milestone forward](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/move-milestone-forward.yml)\n- [Discover](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/discover.yml)\n- [Missed SLO](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/label-missed-slo.yml)\n- [Unlabelled issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/unlabelled-issues.yml) - only when `UNLABELLED_TRIAGE_PACKAGE` is also set\n\n## Run weekly\n- [Team triage package](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/team-triage-package.yml)\n- [Missing categories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/missing-categories.yml)\n- [Community merge requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/community-merge-requests.yml) - only when $COMMUNITY_TRIAGE_PACKAGE is also set\n\n## Proposal\n\nThere are currently two different types of triage policies that I group all policies into. \n\n- `TRIAGE_PACKAGE` - classification of incoming issues and merge requests for a group or project to aid in identifying actionable items for Product and Group/Stage Managers.\n- `TRIAGE_HYGEINE` - label or comment automation to aid in reporting or nudging behavior into desired direction. The daily jobs that don't have `packages` in the job name fit this category to me.\n\nThe job name would be where we can indicate the desired frequency (`schedule:daily:reminders:labels` or `schedule:weekly:packages:community-merge-requests`\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Create new anchors based on the triage categories (ie `triage-package` and `triage-hygeine`) which leverage a different variable.\n1. Convert existing jobs to use the new anchors\n1. Update the README with the new variables description\n1. After merge is completed, update the existing scheduled pipelines variables\n\n\nI am still getting my bearings and lack the historical context. I don't want to create a change that would be confusing. I also don't have great view of where Triage Packages 2.0 and 3.0 and how the evolution of our policies fit within these categories.\n\n@rymai @godfat @markglenfletcher - What are your thoughts?\n\n/cc @meks","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-26T16:37:56.313Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T19:43:56.252Z","closed_at":"2019-08-16T19:43:56.202Z","closed_by":{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle Wiebers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303148/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kwiebers"},"labels":["Quality","backstage [DEPRECATED]"],"milestone":{"id":693521,"iid":35,"group_id":9970,"title":"12.2","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2019/08/22/gitlab-12-2-released","state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-30T16:48:32.567Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:30:20.799Z","due_date":"2019-08-22","start_date":"2019-07-08","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/35"},"assignees":[{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle Wiebers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303148/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kwiebers"}],"author":{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle Wiebers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303148/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kwiebers"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle Wiebers","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303148/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/kwiebers"},"user_notes_count":3,"merge_requests_count":1,"upvotes":2,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/issues/229","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/229","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/229/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/229/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#229","relative":"#229","full":"gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops#229"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":23151613,"iid":225,"project_id":7776928,"title":"Split \"CI \u0026 Runner\" group","description":"## Summary\n\nSplitting one \"CI \u0026 Runner\" group into two \"Continuous Integration\" and \"Runner\" groups.\n\nPlease list the Stage or Group labels changes required.

Add devops stage labels and (where necessary) group labels to merged Merge Requests that have a clear 1:1 mapping between legacy and stage label !184\n   - This accounts for the majority of throughputs and will make them visible in the stages dashboards\n     - https://quality-dashboard.gitlap.com/groups/gitlab-org/stages/devops::create\n     - https://quality-dashboard.gitlap.com/groups/gitlab-org/teams/create\n2. Determine devops stage label to apply to merged Merge Requests that do not have a clear 1:1 mapping\n   - Some MRs have several legacy labels and it's unclear which stage label should be applied\n   - We cannot apply two as stage labels are scoped labels\n   - We can use feature label inference to determine stage labels where possible and manual labelling for the outstanding MRs\n3. Determine devops stage label to apply to merged MRs with no legacy label\n   - We can infer the stage labels from the category labels where possible\n3. Add devops stage labels to open MRs in the same manner as 1, 2, and 3\n   - Not essential as only `merged` MRs are counted for throughputs\n4. Determine group labels for merged MRs through author\n\n\n##### Issues\n1. Add devops stage labels to issues via feature label inference implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/merge_requests/155\n   - We are in the process of rolling this out completely here for both issues and MRs resources  \n      -

Why not implementing the generic part of this feature into `gitlab-triage` directly (i.e. `EngineExtension`, `RulePolicyExtension`, `IssueBuilderExtension#initialize`)? That way we'd only override `IssueBuilderExtension#description` to add the heatmap.\n\n* [ ] Rename `lib/extension.rb` -\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/merge_requests/155\n* [ ] Introduce another object to contain the conditions and the raw resources -\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-triage/issues/147\n* [ ] Expose the raw resources so we can extend it\n\nThe most offending code is:\n\n``` ruby\nyield(resources, conditions.merge(all_resources: all_resources))\n```\n\n@rymai had a comment about it: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/merge_requests/149#note_182469796\n\n\u003e Could we change this method in `gitlab-triage` to directly yield `resources, conditions, resources_without_limit` instead? I find it hackish to merge `all_resources: all_resources` into `conditions` here... :thinking:\n\nTo be honest, I spent a lot of time figuring this out, and I got really confused around this code. This was because the object we put into `BasePolicy#resources` can actually have different types for `SummaryPolicy` and `RulePolicy`.\n\nI left a comment in `lib/gitlab/triage/policies/summary_policy.rb`\n\n``` ruby\n# Due to resources is a different type, this will never work\n# FIXME: We should try to make sure type is consistent for resources\ndef comment?\n  false\nend\n```\n\nThis shares the same issue. Depending on the instance, `resources` can mean different things. In `RulePolicy` it's an array of resources, but in `SummaryPolicy` it's a hash mapping from rules to the resources.\n\nIn order to fix the confusion here, I would like to introduce a new class wrapping it. I don't know how to name it yet, but it should carry the difference.\n\nAnd then, we can attach this `all_resources` (or raw resources) to this object, instead of attaching it to the conditions.\n\nI need to attach it to the conditions for now, because I don't know how to properly attach it to either an array or a hash (!) If we try to detect that, it's going to be even more confusing...\n\nI consider that a ~\"technical debt\" without adding an actual object for that part, and I think we need to fix it now before we move on, because we do need to add something on top of it now.","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-18T17:06:50.761Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T10:26:36.382Z","closed_at":"2019-07-02T12:58:34.856Z","closed_by":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy
