It is important for GitLab to communicate effort spent into a format that is easily understandable widely in the industry. We provide this metric to our leadership reporting and improve the accuracy with subtypes categorization. \n\nAdditionally tracking accurate work output allows the team to compare output to backlog and adjust focus accordingly. \n\n### Proposal\n\n1. Create a type label discussion for non-\\~\"Community contribution\" MRs opened without a type for the [top 20 offending undefined projects](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/1021219/Type-Research?widget=14627996\u0026udv=0) with the below message requesting the MR be classified label. =\u003e https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/merge_requests/1374\n1. Expand to additional projects based on [undefined ratio](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/1021219/Type-Research?widget=14627996\u0026udv=0) (what proportion of merged MRs do not have a type) for projects over 20 MRs in the last 90 days\n1. Expand to all `is_part_of_product` projects\n\n```\n:wave: @#{event.event_actor_username} - please add ~\"type::bug\", ~\"type::feature\", ~\"type::maintenance\", or a [subtype](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification) label to this merge request. \n\n        - ~\"type::bug\": Defects in shipped code and fixes for those defects. This includes all the bug types (availability, performance, security vulnerability, mobile, etc.) \n        - ~\"type::feature\": Effort to deliver new features, feature changes \u0026 improvements. This includes all changes as part of new product requirements like application limits.\n        - ~\"type::maintenance\"`: Up-keeping efforts \u0026 catch-up corrective improvements that are not Features nor Bugs. This includes restructuring for long-term maintainability, stability, reducing technical debt, improving the contributor experience, or upgrading dependencies.\n\n        See [the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification) for more guidance on classifying.

edge case in which approval of a \"draft\" MR triggers a detached pipeline","description":"When a maintainer approves a MR on gitlab, @danger-bot will automatically trigger a new pipeline, stating:\n\n\u003e To ensure full test coverage, a new pipeline has been started.\n\n![CleanShot_2021-09-22_at_18.05.43_2x](/uploads/4cfe22672d42b877eaff27f1d89d9dd6/CleanShot_2021-09-22_at_18.05.43_2x.png)\n\nHowever, if the MR is still marked as a \"Draft\", this new `detached` pipeline is [run against the source branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipelines_for_merged_results.html) rather than against the merged result. I had erroneously presumed that the pipeline triggered upon approval would be against the merged result, and this resulted in gitlab-org/gitlab~3496950 :scream: \n\nWhen I merged gitlab-org/gitlab!69072, I:\n\n1. clicked \"approve\"\n1. clicked \"mark as ready\"\n1. waited for the new pipeline to become visible\n1. clicked \"merge when pipeline succeeds\"\n1. a detached pipeline was run which did not include the latest changes from `master` and missed a test failure which would have occured against a merged result pipeline\n1. the pipeline passed and the merged branch ended up breaking master.\n\nHad I instead clicked \"mark as ready\" _before_ clicking \"approve\", the full merged result pipeline would have been created instead and this test failure would have been caught before it was automatically merged.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nThis behavior _is_ documented, so it is certainly my mistake, but I think if it's possible for @danger-bot to trigger a full merged-result pipeline regardless of the draft state we should configure it to do so (or failing that, it should produce a **warning** saying that the MR is marked as a draft and that a full merged-result pipeline should be triggered.)\n\n-----------\n\nOriginal discussion from gitlab-org/gitlab!70746:\n\n\u003e \u003e I was not cognizant of any behavior change for pipelines triggered within draft MRs\n\u003e\n\u003e Yeah, it's a slightly surprising behaviour, but it is [documented](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipelines_for_merged_results.html) (emphasis mine):\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e When the merge request can’t be merged, the pipeline runs against the source branch only. For example, when:\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e * The target branch has changes that conflict with the changes in the source branch.\n\u003e \u003e * The merge request **is a Draft merge request**.\n\u003e\n\u003e ---\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e The pipeline was triggered by `@danger-bot` automatically upon my approval of the MR, so that’s why it doesn’t show me as the triggerer.\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e Do you think there an actionable issue here @markrian?\n\u003e\n\u003e That does sound like an edge-case bug in our `@danger-bot` tooling, yes (i.e., when the MR is `Draft`).

pinging AppSec team for JiHu contributions after first approval","description":"Following up https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-serverless/-/issues/125, this is brought up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/90253#note_677426770\n\n## Problem\n\nIf we ping the AppSec team too early in the life cycle of a merge request, chances are AppSec team can review too early and the review becomes outdated quickly, therefore a complete re-review might be needed later.\n\n## Proposal\n\nGiven that it's difficult to shift the ping after the \"last\" approval, we can at least shift the ping after the \"first\" approval.\n\nBelow was copied and edited from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/90253#note_677426770\n\n* MR gets submitted\n* Bot makes [the unresolved thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-serverless/-/merge_requests/145/diffs) that acts as a blocker to merging until AppSec can review it (but does not `@-mention` the AppSec team yet)\n* Reviewers/maintainers go through the MR, request some changes, eventually approve it\n* Once approved by the reviewers/maintainers, automation comments in that unresolved thread and pings the AppSec team for a ~~{-final-}~~{+follow up+} approval\n\n## Implementation\n\nWith https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-serverless/-/merge_requests/153 where it can leave a unique mark in the comment, and a way to detect if the unique mark is already being left, we can extend this so that it can find the original thread and attach new comments in the thread.\n\n* Wrap the first AppSec thread with a unique mark\n* When we receive an approval, find the above thread with the unique mark\n* Comment and ping AppSec team on the thread\n* (Bonus) Make sure the thread cannot be resolved before AppSec team member is pinged!\n* (Bonus bonus) Make sure that only team members can resolve the thread!\n\n## Question: Final approval?\n\nIf we may find a good way to determine what is the \"last\" approval, we can as well make AppSec get pinged after that so AppSec team can be the last one to approve.

· 1 hour ago\nOwner\nI think this is due to that table having the .only-gitlab filter applied for the role but the policy is run at the gitlab-org group level so the links in the heatmap go to the group but the counts are for the project.\n```","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-19T22:05:02.804Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T16:55:00.161Z","closed_at":"2021-11-03T16:55:00.006Z","closed_by":{"id":6290669,"username":"godfat-gitlab","name":"Lin

monthly EM bugs/performance issues triage into this project","description":"A monthly job runs in the Plan project (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/) that generates triage issues for EMs in Plan and Create which make it easier to include bugs and performance issues in the release post.\n\n* Job definitions: [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)\n* Schedule: [`0 14 13 * *`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/-/pipeline_schedules)\n* Policies: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/-/tree/master/policies\n* Example issues: [Plan bugs for 14.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/-/issues/342), [Create performance issues for 13.12](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/12853)\n\nA stage-level report is generated that makes it easy for EMs to collaborate by providing a checklist with each item to be triaged, along with a markdown list that can be copied into a commit on the corresponding MR. \n\nThis job has a number of downsides that would benefit from its being moved into this project:\n\n- The creation of the issues in pipelines fails because they trigger spam detection, so they have to be manually copied from artifacts into issues;\n- Maintenance is within the Plan project and is somewhat opaque to other teams.\n\nThe current implementation also has the following drawbacks:\n\n- DRIs are frequently out of date as the SSoT is different from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/blob/master/group-definition.yml;\n- Code is not DRY, each policy is replicated including issue description text. Expanding to other stages requires duplicating policies in full each time;\n- Current milestone isn't usable in title or description.\n\n### Proposal\n\nMove this monthly triage into this project, allowlisting it to Plan and Create only to begin with. Then gradually add stages as they show an interest.\n\nThe following steps could be used:\n\n- [x] Align the current policies as closely as possible with this project's\n   - [x] Remove legacy Ruby script and jobs https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/-/merge_requests/43\n   - [x] Copy the `group-definition.yml` file into the project\n   - [x] Refactor policies to use `group-definition.yml` as the SSoT for EMs and Groups\n- [x] Make a single policy for each triage issue type (bugs and performance issues) that consumes the `group-definition.yml`\n- [x] Move the triage into this project \n- [x] Remove jobs and clean up the Plan project https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/plan/-/merge_requests/51","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-06-16T12:24:50.673Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T16:53:25.767Z","closed_at":"2022-02-14T16:53:25.752Z","closed_by":{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John Hope","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4418630/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/johnhope"},"labels":["Engineering Productivity","ep::triage","priority::3","workflow::verification"],"milestone":null,"assignees":[{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John Hope","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4418630/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/johnhope"}],"author":{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John Hope","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4418630/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/johnhope"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":4418630,"username":"johnhope","name":"John Hope","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4418630/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/johnhope"},"user_notes_count":10,"merge_requests_count":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/issues/701","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":7,"completed_count":7},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":false,"_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/701","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/701/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/701/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#701","relative":"#701","full":"gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops#701"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":88549667,"iid":699,"project_id":7776928,"title":"Update labels to reflect two merged groups","description":"Recently ~\"group::dynamic analysis\" and ~\"group::fuzz testing\" merged, and kept the name ~\"group::dynamic analysis\".

This will also require https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/71331 to specify which exact label we need to use for the group label.\n\nWith this we can fully resolve https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/issues/631\n\nFor now we're just working around it by silencing it when ~\"group:certify\" is added.","state":"closed","created_at":"2021-01-25T16:10:16.351Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T14:01:01.826Z","closed_at":"2021-04-01T15:14:01.097Z","closed_by":{"id":6290669,"username":"godfat-gitlab","name":"Lin Jen-Shin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6290669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/godfat-gitlab"},"labels":["Engineering Productivity","ep::triage","priority::3","type::maintenance"],"milestone":{"id":1406669,"iid":59,"group_id":9970,"title":"13.11","description":"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/archives.html","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-08-13T14:23:09.688Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T07:22:08.835Z","due_date":"2021-04-17","start_date":"2021-03-18","expired":true,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/59"},"assignees":[{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"}],"author":{"id":6290669,"username":"godfat-gitlab","name":"Lin Jen-Shin","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/6290669/avatar.png","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/godfat-gitlab"},"type":"ISSUE","assignee":{"id":128633,"username":"rymai","name":"Rémy Coutable","state":"active","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/263da227929cc0035cb0eba512bcf81a?s=80\u0026d=identicon","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/rymai"},"user_notes_count":2,"merge_requests_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"due_date":null,"confidential":false,"discussion_locked":null,"issue_type":"issue","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/-/issues/640","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"weight":2,"blocking_issues_count":0,"has_tasks":true,"task_status":"0 of 0 checklist items completed","_links":{"self":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/640","notes":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/640/notes","award_emoji":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928/issues/640/award_emoji","project":"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7776928","closed_as_duplicate_of":null},"references":{"short":"#640","relative":"#640","full":"gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops#640"},"severity":"UNKNOWN","moved_to_id":null,"service_desk_reply_to":null,"epic_iid":null,"epic":null,"iteration":null,"health_status":null},{"id":77526286,"iid":639,"project_id":7776928,"title":"Consider retiring the \"Community contributions merge request report\" issue","description":"Now that:\n\n1.

However, we periodically may forget to apply this label consistently, which can also lead to [confusion at times](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1669).\n\nI've definitely done this - the problem isn't that I applied the incorrect label, but that I neglected to apply it at all in the midst of creating multiple issues. In order to prevent this, we should make sure that issues with the current milestone (e.g. issues that are being worked on) have a tiering label so we're being intentional about which tier a feature belongs in.\n\n## Proposal\nSet up a triage policy:\n* If an issue is scheduled for the current milestone AND has a `group::` label AND has a ~direction label AND does not have one of ~\"GitLab Core\", ~\"GitLab Starter\", ~\"GitLab Premium\" , or ~\"GitLab Ultimate\"\n* Then leave a comment in the issue and @ mention the relevant PM to add an appropriate tier label.","state":"closed","created_at":"2020-11-06T01:53:48.716Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T12:06:02.193Z","closed_at":"2021-01-21T12:06:02.084Z","closed_by":{"id":4303148,"username":"kwiebers","name":"Kyle
